<p>There is one reason, amongst others, why the memory of
Christian Frederick Schwartz deserves to be kept green
in the history of missions. It is not generally known that
the consuming passion for the conversion of the heathen
which burned in the soul of Henry Martyn was kindled
at the torch of this veteran witness for the faith. While
still a student at Cambridge, Martyn was profoundly
impressed by reading his journal and letters, and when
he himself arrived in India, ten years after the death of
Schwartz, he took counsel with many who, like Dr. Kerr,
could stir his heart with first-hand stories of the venerable
missionary they had known and loved so well. Happily
for us, these records which moved Martyn so deeply are
still preserved, fresh and vivid, a veritable classic in
missionary literature.</p>

<p>The age of Schwartz, from a missionary point of view,
has scarcely received adequate attention at the hand of
the historian. In that hour of daybreak, missions were
hardly in the making, and, as far as India is concerned,
it may be said that the men who were destined to win the
conquests of the Cross were still boys at their school-books;
indeed, the most distinguished of them were yet unborn.</p>

<p>In those days the English were winning and
stubbornly maintaining a precarious foothold in India by
the ambition of the merchant, the soldier, and the diplomat;
East and West had met in relentless struggle, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</span>
at the gates of the Orient the white man clamoured for
power and conquest. Amid the glare of this conflagration
of war, Schwartz and these early missionaries quietly
pursued their sacred duties, and with weapons not carnal
but spiritual fought their good fight of faith. The pages
of history praise the great achievements of Clive, Warren
Hastings, and Cornwallis as the fathers of our rule there,
but surely Schwartz is also entitled to a niche of honour
as one who laid the foundation of that reign of the
Kingdom of God which thousands of faithful missionaries
are promoting throughout the Indian Empire to-day. It
is the sacred office of the Church to preserve the blessed
memory of her standard-bearers and confessors: the world
will look after its own.</p>

<p>The personality of Schwartz was unique. He seems
to have combined, like Gordon, a singular tenderness with
heroic strength of purpose—a man of action with a strain
of mysticism, a very Bayard in purity and honour in an
age when reputations in India suffered loss. As will be
seen in these pages, he served the civil power well because
the enemy could implicitly trust him. In the audience
chamber of a pagan tyrant he was still a Christian
missionary; he kept his hands clean of bribes, and his
conscience of compromise; his character was a testimony
that “there is no fear in love.”</p>

<p>He had to do his sowing on a very wild and stormy
day, but, though we have now established the Pax
Britannica, some of his difficulties still confront the
modern missionary, and with all our progress and accomplished
methods we find ourselves even now wistfully
experimenting on problems which he too could not solve.
If the compass of the present work permitted, one might
be tempted to discuss a few of these points in modern
missions, which Schwartz, standing on the threshold of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</span>
the new era, foresaw and did his best to meet. But we
have travelled far since then, and if this old-time
missionary could re-visit India he would marvel at the
change. He would find us still puzzled with the problems
of caste, perfecting our widespread system of education,
busy with elaborate schemes of vernacular literature. He
would see European ladies carrying a sweet song and
message of mercy behind the purdah, crowds of patients
waiting at the door of the medical missionary, the suttee
and the Juggernauth car stopped for ever, native judges
presiding in the courts, and a native episcopate an
accomplished fact.</p>

<p>But Schwartz would also see that our western culture
has armed the educated Hindu with a scientific unbelief
which is the destructive enemy of his religion and bitterly
assails our own. With so much to thank God for he
would also recognize that there is still need enough for
fervent prayer and faith that India may be saved.</p>

<p>I may add that the quotations in these pages from the
letters and journals of Schwartz are chiefly drawn from
the original “Remains” published in 1826, and the
two volumes of Dean Pearson’s “Memoirs” of 1839,
supplemented by a few scattered gleanings from other
fields. I should like also to express my indebtedness to
the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, the
Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, the Church
Missionary Society, and many literary friends for placing
at my disposal books of great service.</p>

<p class="ph3">HOW CHRISTIANITY CAME TO INDIA.</p>


<p>Everything is old in the Orient. We of the West, who
talk of a thousand years past as a long time ago, realise a
little as we travel thither, amid relics of a prehistoric age,
how young is our own world when for the first time we
stand on pathways which reach back to the very daybreak
on the horizon of human life. With a child’s wonder turning
the faded parchments of some ancient book or stepping
reverently and softly among the resting-places of the dead,
we feel the past calling to us from behind the veil of the
present, and we cannot escape the impression; we would
not if we could. The spell of its mystery, its spaces of
silence, the hush of living millions now stilled for ever fill
us with awe, as with finger on lip we peer wistfully down
the vista of uncounted years. It is the demand, the insistence
of past history which we cannot afford to ignore, for
without its interpretation we shall never understand to-day.
This is specially true of India. Her ancient temples,
carved by the thin dark fingers of a time when Europe was
in the cradle of its civilization, these shadowy figures of
to-day with glistening white teeth and lustrous jet eyes,
flitting in light raiment under the fronded palms, keeping
up ancestral customs and living as their fathers did a
thousand years ago, make an indelible impression. And
at the back of all this there is a haunting sense of a far off
time when this same glare of sunshine shone upon the same
rushing rivers and wide dry plains, and voices, so like
those now in our ears, spoke with smiles and tears of
human gladness and heart-break so long, so very long ago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span></p>

<p>The history of India is filled with the alarms of war,
state arrayed against state, plunder, devastation, and remorseless
shedding of blood. Her soil has indeed been
made sacred by the slaughter of her sons. But beyond this
story of strife we are looking for something else and asking
another question. Where and how amid these hoary
creeds and worship did a knowledge of the true God as we
know Him, and the Name of the Saviour of the World
first come to the people of this land? The quest of this
is not easy where so much is legend and pious, but perhaps
not quite honest, story telling.</p>

<p>In the age of the Old Testament history when Solomon
was building the temple at Jerusalem it is very probable
that the ships of Hiram, laden with gold and ivory, apes
and peacocks, were bringing their treasures from that land
beyond the Red Sea, which is the India of our to-day. And
it is also likely that upon those shores the trading instinct
of the Hebrews had established stations for the ingathering
of these costly freights, and in this strange land the praises
of Jehovah were heard in some simple synagogue with its
window open towards the sacred city of the Hebrews across
the wide sea.</p>

<p>The centuries pass, and in the fulness of time wise men
from the East, following the guidance of the Star, came to
Bethlehem to worship the Christ child. The Light of the
world had dawned. And it is not inconceivable that the
tidings of One so mighty in word and work would be spread
abroad through the talk of travellers and traders to the
regions eastward of the Holy Land. For what it is worth,
a reference may be made to the letters still preserved in
the British Museum, supposed to have been written during
the life of our Lord by Agbgbar from Edessa. These
record that he, like the Queen of Sheba, was anxious to
know more of what was taking place at Jerusalem and sent
messages to Jesus Christ asking Him to visit him and offering
his protection. When the reply is given that Jesus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
Christ is too much occupied, but that after He had been
received up He would send one of His Apostles, we feel
we are in the midst of a legend, especially when Thomas
is named as the writer of the answer, who afterwards sent
Thaddeus, from whom the succession of the bishops of
Edessa was traced. Before considering the claims of the
St. Thomas theory, which has given his name to the
Christians of the Malabar coast, we must realise the fact
that after Pentecost the inspiration of the early Christian
Church began to show itself in sending forth its witnesses
for the conquest of the world under the Divine mandate
received on the mount at His Ascension. Persecution also
drove them hence; the hate of the Pharisees, the stern
discipline of Roman repression, the prison walls and the
sword of martyrdom—these only spread the embers which
elsewhere broke out in fresh flames of testimony.</p>

<p>In the year 70 Jerusalem was destroyed and the soldiers
of Titus completed the overthrow of the Jewish Kingdom.
The people who in their pride and contempt had cried
“Crucify Him” were now flying in terror from their
doomed city, and many must have escaped to reach the
refuge of those trading settlements on the shores of India.
In support of this view it may be mentioned that there is
in the Library of the University of Cambridge a facsimile
of a copper plate of the greatest interest, found in the
Jewish Colony at Cochin, which bears a Hebrew inscription
to this effect:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“After the second temple was destroyed (which
may God speedily rebuild!) our fathers dreading the
conquerors’ wrath departed from Jerusalem, a numerous
body of men, women, priests and Levites, and
came unto this land.”</p>
</div>

<p>Possibly among these fugitives Christians came, some
maybe with personal memories of the life and ministry of
our Lord, others, converts of the Apostles, stray Jews who
had embraced the Christian faith, or Gentiles who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
renounced their idolatry and gratefully accepted the
Gospel. It is therefore not improbable that at this time
and under these conditions Christianity first came to India.</p>

<p>But the Church on the Malabar coast still cherishes its
tradition that St. Thomas laid its foundations when he
landed on the island of Melankara near Kranganur. The
source of this story is the apocryphal Acts of Thomas and
the Martyrdom of Thomas, written towards the end of the
third century. These records state that the Indian King
Gondophares sent Abbanes to Jerusalem to find an
architect or builder, and that in the slave market there
Jesus Christ sold St. Thomas to him for £3 worth of uncoined
silver! After this the recital of sundry extraordinary
miracles wrought by the Apostle at the King’s
court falls on rather unbelieving ears. The only item of
fact which proves the existence of King Gondophares was
the discovery, some years ago, of coins bearing his effigy
among the mountains of Iran and an inscription showing
that he was reigning during the lifetime of Jesus Christ
and also that the Greek language was evidently known in
that district.</p>

<p>The genuine Thomas legend, however, has probably no
reference to the Apostle but to a Bishop of Edessa of that
name, who in the year <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 345 landed at Malabar with a
company of presbyters, youths and maidens gathered from
Jerusalem, Baghdad and Nineveh, and he it was who
probably founded Kranganur. He is known as Thomas
Cananaus.</p>

<p>The Thomas tradition is perpetuated by a cathedral
of simple dimensions in the neighbourhood of Madras
which is dedicated to his memory, while another church
three miles from St. George’s offers the faithful the privilege
of entering the floor and taking a handful of earth
as a cure for diseases, because the ashes of the saint were
found there. The bones, however, were religiously taken
by John III of Portugal to a church at Goa, where they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
are still an object of worship. At St. Thomas’ Mount near
Madras there is a granite stone upon which is carved a
cross and dove with outspread wings, probably the work
of the seventh century. The inscription, which is in
Pelhavi or ancient Persian, says: “In punishment by the
Cross was the suffering of this One who is the true Christ
God above and Guide ever pure,” according to Dr. Burnell.
But another expert, Dr. Haug of Munich, rather expands
the literal meaning as “He that believes in the Messiah
and in God in the height and also in the Holy Ghost is
in the grace of Him who suffered the pain of the cross.”
Two other crosses are preserved in the ancient Church of
Cottayam in Travancore; upon one of these a portion of
the old Pelhavi inscription has been replaced by a quotation
from Galatians vi. 14, “Let us not glory except in
the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.” These crosses are full
of antiquarian interest and seem to indicate Persian influence
on the Christian Churches of South India and also go
to prove the existence of Christianity on the Coromandal
coast in these early centuries.</p>

<p>Going back to a much earlier time, we meet with the
name of a man who perhaps deserves, according to definite
historical data, the credit of being the first to come as a
missionary to India. It is that of Pantaenus. Eusebius
in his Church History gives us the following reference to
him:</p>

<p>“About the year 180 there were still many evangelists
who sought to imitate the godly zeal of the Apostles by
contributing their share to the extension and upbuilding
of the Kingdom of God. Among these was Pantaenus,
who is reputed to have reached the Indians, amongst whom
he is stated to have found the Gospel of St. Matthew,
which, prior to his arrival, was in the possession of many
who had known Christ. To these Bartholomew, one of the
Apostles, is reported to have preached and to have left
behind him the Gospel of St. Matthew in Hebrew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
characters, which had been retained up to the time in
question. This Pantaenus, after many praiseworthy
achievements, was at last placed at the head of the school
at Alexandria.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>It is a moot point among scholars whether the sphere of
this great missionary was not Southern Arabia, but Egypt
and India were at this period closely connected by trade,
and the Roman coins found at Coimbatore and Calicut, in
the year 1850, of the time of Tiberius, Augustus and Nero,
show the possibility of India being indicated. Besides, the
words of Jerome are explicit: “On account of the fame of
his superior learning Pantaenus was sent to India by
Bishop Demetrius (of Alexandria) to preach Christ among
the Brahmans and philosophers there.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>This much is clear; this distinguished Greek, by birth
an Athenian, by culture of the School of the Stoics, was
at the head of a great college for catechists at Alexandria
and exercised a powerful influence upon his students,
among whom Clement and Origen were the most famous.
Pantaenus trained his pupils to look beyond their immediate
horizon and proclaim the Gospel of Christ to a then
unknown world. Alexandria was a cosmopolitan city; all
sorts and conditions of humanity, from all quarters of the
world, flocked there. They came for trade, for intellectual
treasure, and some for light on the great question of
religion. It may be that in the pathways of his own city
Pantaenus met Brahmans with their philosophic sense of
superiority and Buddhist priests steeped in the calm of intellectual
repose. All this would stimulate and influence
a mind such as his. He longed to bring to their homeland
a better Gospel and a word of truth which would reveal to
them the only true God and Jesus Christ Whom He had
sent. We have the high authority of Eusebius for the
statement that “he was distinguished as an expositor of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
the Word of God,” and it was said of him that he “had
penetrated most profoundly into the Spirit of Scripture.”</p>

<p>It may be that amongst this crowd of visitors from
other countries some would apply to Bishop Demetrius for
a missionary to be sent to India; indeed, it is stated that
some of the catechists who had passed under the hands of
Pantaenus did actually beseech him to come and nourish
the faith and bless the lives of the Christians scattered
abroad. When he went and how long he stayed with the
Church on the Malabar coast we know not, for as yet no
fragment of ancient history gives any sign. But the alleged
discovery of the autograph Gospel of St. Matthew
amongst these Jewish Christians awakens our interest. It
was believed that this Gospel, written in Aramaic, was
brought thither by St. Bartholomew after the martyrdom
of St. Stephen. After his visit Pantaenus brought back this
precious MS. in the year <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 211 when he returned to take
up his old position with the catechumens in Alexandria.
We would fain know more of this strong and cultured man,
to whom was entrusted the task of instructing the Church
at a period when already the bitterest doctrinal differences
had arisen within her borders, and also of strengthening,
as doubtless he did, the hearts of the little colony of
Christian believers on the Malabar coast. These probably
held the Faith not unalloyed with errors born of ignorance
within and their environment without.</p>

<p>Once more the veil of obscurity, like a shifting mist,
settles on that Indian Church; no word breaks the silence,
no streak of light enables us to see the growing powers of
this faithful few, hedged in by Judaism on the one hand
and the native religions on the other.</p>

<p>In the year <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 345 Thomas Cananaus, as we have
seen, landed in Malabar. Two centuries afterwards the
Egyptian merchant and traveller, Cosmas Indicopleustes,
journeyed thither, and we get another glimpse, disappointingly
meagre, of the Christians in India.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>“What I have seen,” says he, “and experienced in the
majority of places during my stay I truthfully declare.
On the Island of Taprobane (<i>i.e.</i> Ceylon), in Inner India,
where the Indian Ocean is, there is to be found a community
of Christians, consisting of both clergy and the
faithful, but I do not know whether there are any
Christians to be found beyond this. Similarly in Male
(Malabar, perhaps more particularly Quilon, which was
later known by the Arabs as Kullam-male) where pepper
grows and in the place called Caliana (Kalyan near
Bombay) there is also a Bishop, who receives imposition
of hands from Persia, as well as in the isle called the Isle
of Discoris in the same Indian Sea. The inhabitants of
that island speak Greek, having been originally settled
there by the Ptolemies who ruled after Alexander of
Macedon. There are clergy there also, ordained and sent
from Persia to minister among the people of the island, and
a multitude of Christians.... In a very great number
of places one found churches of Christians with Bishops,
martyrs, monks and recluses, wherever in fact the Gospel
of Christ had been proclaimed.”</p>

<p>This extract, taken with its context, not only proves
how widely dispersed the Christian faith had become in the
fifth century but also attracts our attention to the diffusion
of the Nestorian doctrine which, with its imperfect presentation
of Christianity, carried everywhere the element
of its own failure, even where apparently such a success.
It was an age in which, humanly speaking, the Church
had her magnificent opportunity, but being divided and
unworthy she failed to carry conquest. Had she remained
true to the Apostolic teaching how different it might have
been!</p>

<p>Again the curtain falls and for six centuries the Syrian
Church on the Malabar coast is out of sight and mind.
Just a break for a moment in the year <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 883 when we
see two priests of the Anglo-Saxon Church, Sighelm and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
Athelstan, taking to India the votive offerings of the great
King Alfred of England, which he had promised to the
shrine of St. Thomas during his siege of London. We
only know they went and returned safely.</p>

<p>But during these centuries Islam was advancing, its
crescent banners red with blood, its eyes fired with hatred,
trampling in its onrush the Christian Churches and all
other religions and effacing only too effectively the fruit of
the work of evangelizing Asia. The seats of learning, the
sacred temples of the Christian faith, the priceless archives
rich in the thought and piety of the age, the seven Churches
of the Apocalyptic messages, all were overthrown as the
Crescent supplanted the Cross. The tide of conquest not
only overran the holy places of the East, but flung itself
against the ramparts of European Christianity. The peril
of the age woke the chivalry of the Crusaders, and the
flower of Knighthood perished in trying to wrest the sacred
spots of Palestine from the Infidel.</p>

<p>Scarcely had this storm spent itself when another cloud
arose in the East and burst with force and rage. The
great Mongol chieftain Chengis Khan, beating down Islam
with its own weapon, had made himself master of China
and the whole of Western Asia, and now, flushed with
victory, essayed to conquer Europe also. Islam had
brought the flag of the prophet as far as the gates of
Vienna; Chengis Khan on that fateful day in April, 1241,
broke down the defence of Prince Henry at Liegnitz. It
seemed as though all Europe lay defenceless, when
suddenly, by one of the great acts of God in history, the
Tartar host like a swarm of locusts arose and departed
whence they came.</p>

<p>Then we see the Church of Rome diplomatically trying
to meet the desire of Kubla Khan to make some alliance
with the Christian Kingdoms of Europe against Islam,
their common foe. It is an amazing fact, well worth keeping
in mind, that, after the visit of Polo to his court, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
Khan of Persia actually wrote letters to the French King
asking for “a hundred Christians, intelligent men, acquainted
with the seven arts, well justified to enter into
controversy and able clearly to prove by force of argument
to idolators and other kinds of folk that the law of Christ
was best, and that all other religions were false and
naught; and that if they would prove this he and all under
him would become Christians and the Church’s liegemen.”
It is disappointing to find that this open door did not admit
the pure Gospel; it was a cry from Macedon with no St.
Paul to answer it.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE FRIAR AND THE LUTHERAN.</p>


<p>It was Marco Polo, after his travels in the East at the end
of the thirteenth century, who first awoke the Church in
Europe to take some interest in the Christian community
far away in India. He told the tale of what he had seen
on his visit to Malabar, how that the shrine of St. Thomas
attracted many pilgrims and that cures were wrought by
a handful of sacred dust from his grave. Also that
the church which contained the body of the martyr
was supported by the produce of the groves of coco-nut
palm trees, and that in the vicinity were many Jews. Here
then was the ancient Syrian Church preserving the flickering
flame of truth amid the darkness of heathenism.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the two great Orders of the Middle Ages, the
Franciscans and the Dominicans, were, at the bidding of
the Popes, carrying far and wide the missions by which the
all-embracing power and authority of Rome would assert
itself, not only in making converts, but in bringing the
political power of courts into its grasp and subjection. In
the year 1319 a group of friars sailed for the Far East and
found themselves on the shores of India (near the modern
Bombay), and the leader of them, Jordan or Jordanus, during
a stay of two years, visited the Nestorian churches and
travelled amid many perils, for the leaders of Islam were
oppressing the Christians. The true mission of Jordan
was doubtless to bring the Nestorians to acknowledge the
supremacy of the Pope, for up to this time they accepted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
only the rule of their own Archbishop at Bandas
(Baghdad). He bitterly complains in his letters to the
Pope of the disorder in doctrine which prevails. Not even
the rite of baptism is administered and many are so
ignorant that they believe Saint Thomas the Great to be
the Christ. This friar had, however, the saving quality
of optimism, especially in the work of his own Order, for
he says, “Of the conversion of those nations of India I
say this, that if there were two or three hundred good friars
who would faithfully and fervently preach the Catholic
faith, there is not a year that would not see more than
ten thousand persons converted to the Christian faith.”</p>

<p>With the dawn of the sixteenth century we meet the
awakening of that spirit of discovery which was to affect
so deeply the missionary enterprise of the world. Vasco
da Gama had already visited India in May, 1498, and henceforward
from Portugal, the faithful son of the Romish
Church, sailed ships of exploration and adventure to
establish trading colonies, upon the decks of which were
hundreds of friars. Churches, monasteries, and colleges
sprang up wherever they landed, and Goa, raised to the
dignity of a bishopric, became the flourishing centre of
Church and Empire. One of the most significant events
of this age, however, was the meeting together on the Feast
of the Assumption, in the year 1534, of Ignatius Loyola and
six friends to establish the Society of Jesus. One of them
was a young man who had been reared amid Protestant
influences and was related on his mother’s side to the Kings
of Navarre. This was Francis Xavier, whose name and
character is a glowing point in the history of that time.
Shorn of the legends which his Church has woven about
his career, the great missionary cannot fail to command
the attention and admiration of the historian, and, as his
first sphere was India, he deserves a special reference in
the early history of Christian missions there. At first his
royal patron, John III of Portugal, hesitated whether he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
should not keep Xavier at home, but eventually he was
sent with the new Viceroy and a suite of notables in a well-equipped
fleet of seven vessels to Goa on the 7th April, 1541.
The young monk, burning with missionary zeal, looked
across the waters with a beating heart. He did not lack
authority, temporal and spiritual, for he went out as Papal
Nuncio to the new world, with full powers to propagate
the faith of the Church of Rome in all the East, was recommended
to the care of David, King of Ethiopia, and all
the princes and governors were urged to pay him respect
and service. But his heart’s desire was not dependent
upon these. He came as one ready to suffer and bear
trials, and to the end of his life these were bravely borne.
The inner spirit and purpose of the man is best revealed in
his letters, and when he arrived at Goa, and saw what
awaited him, he wrote thus home to his friends:</p>

<p>“I am persuaded that those who truly love the Cross
of Christ esteem a life thus passed in affliction to be a
happy one and regard an avoidance of the cross or an exemption
from it as a kind of death. For what death is
more bitter than to live without Christ when once we have
tasted His preciousness; or to desert Him, that we may
follow our own desires? Believe me, no cross is to be
compared with this cross. On the other hand, how happy
it is to live in dying daily and in mortifying our own will
and in seeking not our own but the things that are Jesus
Christ’s! I trust that through the merits and prayers of
our holy mother the Church, in which is my chief confidence,
and through the prayers of its living members, to
which you belong, our Lord Jesus Christ will sow the
Gospel seed in this heathen land by my instrumentality,
though a worthless servant. Especially if He shall be
pleased to use such a poor creature as I am for so great a
work it may shame the men who are born for great achievements,
and it may stir up the courage of the timid, when
forsooth they see me, who am but dust and ashes and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
most abject of men, a visible witness of the great want of
labourers.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>With a spirit so brave and aims so high and self-renouncing,
one cannot help wondering what he might
not have done had he preached a purer creed and been less
fettered and influenced by political association. His landing
at Goa, with the whole heathen and Mohammedan
millions to win for Christ, was rather a bad beginning,
since being under the orders of the Viceroy he had to limit
himself to the pearl fishers at Tuticorin. Here he had to
make Christians in order to bring a valuable industry to
Portuguese advantage, an arrangement having already
been made whereby the fishermen were willing to change
their religion if they might be protected against the
Mohammedans.</p>

<p>Xavier knew nothing of the language and did not seem
to think it necessary at any time to learn. He went from
village to village with a hand bell, getting the crowd of
boys to repeat after him words of the Creed, the Lord’s
Prayer and Ave Maria, and then as opportunity offered
baptising old and young wholesale. He admits his difficulties
when he writes: “Conceive therefore what kind
of life I live in this place, what kind of sermons I am able
to address to the assemblies when they who should repeat
my address to their people do not understand me or I them.
I ought to be an adept in dumb show. Yet I am not without
work, for I want no interpreter to baptise infants just
born or those which their parents bring, nor to relieve the
famished and the naked who come in my way. So I devote
myself to these two kinds of good works and do not regard
my time as lost.”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> So little did his catechumens understand
what they were doing that he admits to his companion
Mansilla that he found they were stumbling over
the very first sentence of the creed and saying “I will”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
(<i>volo</i>) instead of “I believe” (<i>credo</i>) in their baptismal
services.</p>

<p>Leaving the pearl fishers after a year’s work the great
Jesuit turned his attention to the conversion of princes
and kings. He gained great influence over the King of
Travancore, using it for the protection of Christians, for
many of the members of the old Syrian Church were living
on the western coast of his dominions and suffered much
from the oppression of tax gatherers. The truth of his
labours is sadly exaggerated and overladen with the
legends of his Jesuit biographers, who relate miracles performed
by him even so improbable as the raising of the
dead. Twenty years after his death, when he was
canonized by Gregory XV as a Saint, these miracles were
set forth to his honour, among them being a gift of tongues
by which without any learning he could fluently speak any
language, a statement which his own letters prove to be a
fiction.</p>

<p>It is not within the scope of the present work to deal
with anything beyond his three years’ work in India, which
leaves the greater portion of his deeply interesting career
unrecorded. This first attempt to evangelize the world
certainly gave him no content or satisfaction. He writes
on 14th January, 1549, on the eve of his leaving for Japan,
these words of keen disappointment, speaking of India:—“The
natives, on account of the enormity of their wickedness,
are as little as possible fitted to embrace the Christian
religion. They so abhor it that they have no patience to
listen to us if we introduce the subject. To ask them to
become Christians is like asking them to submit to
death.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>On his return he spent some months in arranging the
work of the crowd of Jesuits who had followed him, but it
cannot be said that he renewed his original plan of preaching
<i>Christianity</i> in a simple and elementary manner to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
nations of India. But with all his limitations he stands
on the horizon of history as one of the greatest missionaries
his Church ever knew. He had the courage of a hero and
the piety of a martyr, and his end, as he died of fever in a
dirty hut on the Island of Sancian, amid unsympathetic
strangers, without the rites of his Church, with his glowing
eyes wistfully looking towards the China he hoped to win,
forms a sad but not inappropriate close to his life.</p>

<p>His less distinguished successors are deserving of only
a brief mention. Their methods were open to grave objection,
and, indeed, were condemned by Pope Clement XI.
The Jesuit influence declined with the decay of Portuguese
power and the advance of that of the Dutch. The newcomers
were not disposed to favour Roman Catholic
missionaries; it could hardly be expected that the nation
which withstood the arrogance of Philip of Spain could
tolerate with equanimity the Jesuits in their Eastern
possessions. On the other hand, the missionaries of the
Reformed Protestant faith were naturally encouraged to
go forward, and in Ceylon the Dutch missionaries won
great though ephemeral successes.</p>

<p>We must now look at the part played by Denmark in
the evangelization of India. This was largely due in the
first instance to that enlightened Christian King Frederick
IV, who having concluded a long and disastrous war with
Charles XII of Sweden was able to turn his attention to
the work of evangelizing the East. In this he was
prompted by Dr. Lütkens, his chaplain, who was also
interested in the development of a strip of territory
purchased from the Rajah of Tanjore. Here then was the
moment of providential opportunity and soon the man
appeared who was ready and willing to embrace it.</p>

</figure>

<p>In the little town of Pulsnitz in Lusatia was a youth
named Bartholomew Ziegenbalg, who was born on 24th
June, 1683. The fatherless boy, who had lost his mother
a few years before, recalled her words about gathered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
treasure: “Seek it in your Bible, my dear children, you
will find it there, for I have watered every leaf with my
prayers.” His studies were in the direction of a
ministerial career, which he felt God had placed before
him, but his weak health and lack of means were
hindrances to this. Through the kindness of friends,
however, he was able to study at Halle under the direction
of Professor A. H. Francke, and eventually he was
discovered by Dr. Lütkens and, with his friend Henry
Plütschau, was appointed to go to India. He set sail on the
29th November, 1705. He left behind many friends who
wished him God-speed, but not a few, of little faith and
equal grace of soul, sneered at his zeal and predicted
nothing but failure and shame.</p>

<p>Through a long and stormy passage he worked hard to
acquire a knowledge of Portuguese, and at last, reaching
his destination, stepped ashore without a friend to meet or
welcome him and his companion to this strange land.
They were evidently not wanted in India. On every hand
they looked round only to find a fresh trial of their faith.</p>

<p>The natives were bigoted Hindus and Mohammedans,
whose tongue had to be mastered; added to this the
Europeans, with the flimsiest semblance of a Christian
profession, were living dissolute and mercenary lives which
brooked no interference. It is the old story, many times
repeated since then. The name of Christ was profaned by
the white people who were supposed to represent and
honour it. Said a native to a chaplain: “Christian
religion! Devil religion! Christian much drunk, much
do wrong, much beat, much abuse others!” But
Ziegenbalg and his comrade had come to warn their unruly
brethren and to vindicate the power and grace of Christ to
the heathen. They taught the children in schools, they
learned Tamil in order to preach, and toiled with an unremitting
zeal which soon broke down the health of poor
Ziegenbalg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>It is marvellous to see what the faith and persistency
of these brave men could accomplish. This is what
Ziegenbalg writes about the building of their little church:</p>

<p>“We began, in great poverty but in firm trust and
confidence in God, to build in a great heathen street in the
city, and though we did not know how we should bring the
work to a conclusion, God so strengthened our faith amidst
obstacles, that we spent upon it all we could save from our
salaries and whatever we had laid up before. Many
mocked us but some were moved to pity and to help us.
Thus this house of assembly was carried on with all speed,
thirty persons, who were all heathens, working on it daily.
On the 4th of August, 1707 (exactly two months after
laying the first stone), it was consecrated in both
languages, in the presence of a great number of Christians,
Mohammedans and heathen, and the church received the
name of New Jerusalem.”</p>

<p>Wherever he went he entered into conversation with
the people on the subject of religion and was bold in
declaring that their idols were naught. It was also his
custom to gather at Negatapatam the learned Brahmins for
a discussion sometimes lasting for five hours, and on one
occasion one of these declared that the Supreme Being had
revealed Himself to Europeans in one way and to Hindus
in another; they might believe in Jesus Christ, but the
Hindus were equally right in worshipping idols; a virtuous
life was the one thing needful. “My friend,” said
Ziegenbalg, “no man can lead such a life but by the help of
Christ, but it is not in my power to make you perceive this;
go home and bow down humbly before the supreme Lord
of All and ask Him to show you how it is necessary to believe
in Jesus Christ and own Him for your Redeemer.”</p>

<p>His greatest difficulty seems to have been with the civil
authorities, and Hassius, the governor of Tranquebar, an
ill-conditioned Jack-in-office, actually struck the missionary
on the breast during an outburst of passion and had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
him arrested on some frivolous pretext and conducted from
his study just as he was, in dressing gown and slippers,
through the streets under an armed escort. For four
months he was immured in a dark cell, deprived of pen and
paper and books, the governor thereby hoping to break his
spirit so that his prisoner might beg for release and return
to Europe. But he had mistaken the mettle of his man.
The answer of Ziegenbalg to this insolent suggestion was:
“I bear you no ill will, but you may see that I do not fear
you in the least.” Meanwhile, crowds outside clamoured
for his release, even the natives who did not accept his
religion holding him in deep respect and honour. When
he eventually returned to his work he found the Christians
all scattered by persecution, his schools closed, and, to add
to his troubles, the ship which was bringing him money
and supplies had foundered at sea. Soon afterwards, however,
a letter came to him from the King of Denmark, and
three brethren, Gründler, Bövingh and Jordan, arrived to
strengthen his hands.</p>

<p>Ten years before this, the Society for Promoting
Christian Knowledge had been established and these
English friends were destined to become the faithful and
effectual supporters of Ziegenbalg and the Danish Mission
in India. Through their agency the work was made widely
known to England and Europe, and help was sent out for
the translation of the Holy Scriptures and the opening of
schools. The chaplains of the English forts at Madras,
Calcutta and Bombay were entreated to show the missionary
and his flock every favour. Ziegenbalg’s companion,
Plütschau, had to return to Europe on account of failing
health, but the work grew and extended in different
directions. One of the notable converts at this time was
a Tamil poet, Kanabadi by name, who was asked by
Ziegenbalg to translate some portions of the Bible into
that language and by doing so was led into the light.
Afterwards he rendered the life of Christ into verse and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
used to sing it with the children on the housetops in the
cool of the evening. Whatever great things our nation
has done for India since then—and the Church has poured
forth without stint her best treasure and noble witnesses for
the salvation of its people—the palm of credit must be
given to Denmark and Germany for the pioneer missionary
efforts. The great missionaries of England were yet
unborn, but the hearts of many godly people were deeply
stirred by the tidings of what was being dared and done by
the Lutheran brethren who had gone forth with their Bibles
in their hands. Their letters home had been translated
into English by the Rev. A. W. Boehme, the German
chaplain of Prince George of Denmark (the uncle of King
Frederick), and these were sent to the Society for the
Propagation of the Gospel, asking their sympathy and
help. The latter, however, it was not in their power,
under their original charter, to give, as they were limited
to the “English Plantations and Colonies,” so the appeal
came to the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge,
which was not so bound in its action. Thus it came to
pass in the order of Divine Providence that this Society
should have the privilege of expressing the pious liberality
and equally precious direction which the Christian love
and faith in England placed at the service of the needs of
India. Its practical sympathy was shown at once by
sending many copies of the New Testament in Portuguese
to Tranquebar and a printing press with a fount of Roman
type, together also with one Jonas Fincke, a printer by
trade. These, however, were perilous days for ships, and
the French captured the ship off Brazil, which seems a
little out of her course, and took Fincke as a prisoner of
war. In the end he was set free but died at the Cape of
Good Hope of fever and the belated press arrived in India
the following year. Fortunately, one of the soldiers of the
East India Company was found who could work a press,
and thus catechisms, hymn books and tracts began for the
first time to be printed for the mission.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>In 1714 Ziegenbalg returned to his native land for a
little rest, freely forgiving his old foe the Governor, who
trembled for the consequences if the King heard of his
shameful conduct. Bövingh, full of fault-finding, was
already on his way back to Germany, scarcely on friendly
terms with his old leader and comrade. Ziegenbalg
reached the camp when the King was engaged in the siege
of Stralsund and his reception was a remarkable tribute
to his character.</p>

<p>“One evening there was evidently a profound movement
among the Danish troops. A stranger of note had
had an audience with the King, who had shown him
singular favour, and for hours, it was said, they had been
closeted together. The soldiers who had gathered round
may have been disappointed when they saw he was only
a clergyman, a man indeed of commanding presence, of a
wonderful dignity and fire, resolute and calm, with a keen
eye, a bronzed and almost swarthy face seamed with deep
lines of care, and a winning courtesy and lovableness of
manner. But when he opened his lips and preached to
them and they heard it was Ziegenbalg, the missionary
from Tranquebar, there were some at least who ceased to
wonder at his welcome from the King. To the camp
Ziegenbalg had hurried with all speed. Letters had given
no warning of his journey and he seemed to have dropped
out of the clouds. He was accustomed to rapid movements,
and he had no time to spare, but he got his story told
to the King and was content. Some days were snatched
from war for this work of peace, changes and arrangements
were proposed in the management of the mission,
Ziegenbalg was informed that his patent of superintendent
had already been sent out to India, and for details he was
referred to Copenhagen. Thither he journeyed with restless
speed, and then into Germany to Francke at Halle,
halting little at any place and preaching to vast crowds
who filled the churches and swayed out into the street,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
‘very weak,’ we are told, ‘yet kindling by his presence the
zeal of all the mission friends and moving his audience as
he would by his glowing appeals.’”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>His visit to England was specially gratifying to
Ziegenbalg. He was personally for the first time to meet
all those good friends of the Society for Promoting
Christian Knowledge who had so liberally supplied him
with money, books and letters full of encouragement. At
a meeting of the Society he was welcomed with an eloquent
Latin address, to which he replied in Tamil. Before his
return the aged missionary was presented to King
George I, the Prince and Princess of Wales, the Archbishop
of Canterbury, the Bishop of London and other
eminent persons, and afterwards in 1717 the King wrote
him a letter in Latin in which he said: “We pray you
may be endued with health and strength of body, that you
may long continue to fulfil your ministry with good success,
of which we shall be rejoiced to hear, so you will always
find us ready to succour you in whatever may tend to
promote your work and to excite your zeal.”</p>

<p>Two years afterwards when Archbishop Wake was
acting as President of the Society he sent to Ziegenbalg
and his colleague Gründler a Latin letter full of good
wishes. The following extract will show the spirit of this
Apostolic epistle:—</p>

<p>“Your praise it will be (a praise of endless duration on
earth and followed by a just recompense in Heaven) to have
laboured in the vineyard which yourselves have planted,
to have declared the Name of Christ where it was not
known before and through much peril and difficulty to have
converted to the faith those among whom you afterwards
fulfilled your ministry. Your province therefore,
brethren, your office, I place before all dignities in the
Church. Let others be pontiffs, patriarchs, or popes, let<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
them glitter in purple, in scarlet or in gold, let them seek
the admiration of the wondering multitude and receive
obeisance on the bended knee. You have acquired a better
name than they and a more sacred fame. Admitted into
the glorious society of the prophets, evangelists and
apostles, ye with them shall shine like the sun among his
lesser stars in the Kingdom of your Father, for ever.”</p>

<p>The subsequent years spent at Tranquebar were a
mingled experience of blessing, progress and difficulties,
and disappointment at the loss of some very promising
converts. And the time for the departure of Ziegenbalg
drew near. It is painful to hear that the sorrow which
hastened his end was not the opposition of unbelievers but
the persecution of a man who for a time was the presiding
power on the Missionary Board at Copenhagen. With a
narrow and uncharitable spirit he assailed Ziegenbalg and
his co-workers, trying to force upon the already wearied
workers theories and orders as foolish as unkind.
Ziegenbalg answered this mandate with a dying hand, but
the mischief was already wrought. He was not the first
brave witness of Christ who has laid down his life in a
storm. On Christmas Day, 1719, he preached to his flock
for the last time, and after much patient suffering, interspersed
with tender counsel, meditation and prayer, he
asked to be seated in his armchair and that they would sing
his favourite hymn—written by Louisa Henrietta, Electress
of Brandenburg.</p>


<p class="center">“Jesus Meine Zuversicht.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">Though the night of death be fraught</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Still with many an anxious thought.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As the voices filled the chamber he caught the sound of
other music beyond the river and passed heavenward. Old
before his time, for he was scarcely thirty-six, Ziegenbalg<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
had put into those years a consecrated labour which was
evidenced by the four hundred converts and catechumens
who followed their stricken shepherd to his rest. He was
buried in the Jerusalem Church he had built, and the
remains of his colleague, Gründler, are also within those
walls. On the other side of the way is the old Danish
Government Church of Zion, built in the early days of the
mission. In the vestry is suspended a curious representation
of the Last Supper carved in high relief and painted,
the Latin inscription underneath being:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Tu vis esse meus per coenam, Christe, sacratam:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fac, Amor, aeternum sim maneamque tuus.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It may be said with truth of Ziegenbalg that he was
a born pioneer, undaunted in courage, fertile in resource,
patient and yet full of inspiration, with a remarkable gift
of organization. Plütschau, his comrade, on the other
hand, was differently made, a timid, faithful, earnest and
pensive man.</p>

</figure>

<p>After the loss of its leader the mission soon suffered
again. Gründler, a faithful and able man, ordained by
the Bishop of Zealand in 1708, under the same provocation
from Copenhagen which killed his chief, died of a broken
heart the year following, and the three young missionaries
who came to pick up the thread were good but scarcely
sufficient for the task. Benjamin Schultze was an
intellectual and talented man, with linguistic gifts, which
he used in translating the Bible, in this respect completing
the work which Ziegenbalg had left unfinished. When he
felt called to leave Tranquebar and make Madras his sphere
of work Schultze showed his capacity for work and great
ability. The school he started in Black Town was very
successful; so many men came to visit him, asking for
Christian teaching, that he was compelled to fix an hour
every day to preach to them. While diligent with his
pen it was his stated opinion that “<i>viva voce</i> preaching,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
the testimony of a living man, had a great advantage over
the private reading of books.” But Schultze did both.
He mastered the difficult Telegu; worked hard at
Hindustani in order that, as this was the language used
by the Mohammedans, he might translate the New
Testament and part of the Old, and also write a refutation
of the Koran. But he ruled badly, being restless and
lacking in dignity. He could not get on with his
colleagues, Sartorius and Geister, most excellent brethren,
who were the first two missionaries sent out by the S.P.C.K.
The committee had hoped that, by persuading Schultze to
open a new mission at Cuddalore and leaving these
colleagues at Madras, peace might be maintained.
Certainly the epistle they sent to him is a model of
considerate insistency.</p>

<p>“You have, good sir, we believe, as few failings as any
missionary in India, and as warm a zeal to promote the
Glory of God. Do what you can to sacrifice your chiefest
failing to this Zeal, and to mortify the least degree of pride
that can tempt you to assume a Superiority or Rule over
your fellow labourers, altho’ your merit may make you
worthy of it and would probably command it of them, if
you did not assume it.”</p>

<p>Schultze, however, declined to move, and as a consequence
Sartorius and Geister began the work at
Cudalore (as then spelt), where the former died in 1738 and
was buried in the English burial ground with every mark
of respect.</p>

<p>Schultze finally returned to Germany in broken health,
after twenty-four years of work in India. For years after,
he served the cause of missions at Halle, and to him the
honour was given of numbering amongst his students the
distinguished and noble man who is the subject of the
present biography.</p>

<p>Another, Keistenmacher by name, died after a few
weeks of his arrival. The question of caste in the Church<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
had become an “apple of dissension,” and two new
missionaries, Walther and Pressier, reversing the practice
of Schultze, maintained the toleration of caste as a matter
of principle so that the Sudras were now kept a yard apart
from the Pariahs, and their children in the schools
separated. One important development marked this
period of the mission: Aaron, a native catechist who had
been baptised by Ziegenbalg, was ordained a minister
according to the rights of the Lutheran Church, and
sent to Tanjore. Other missionaries came out from
Europe. One only perhaps needs specific mention here,
Philipp Fabricius, who arrived at Madras in 1742 and for
fifty years laboured with much wisdom and patience. He
made a close study of Tamil literature and is always to be
remembered as the hymn writer of the Tamil Christians.
He was pre-eminently a scholar; indeed so slow and
reverent was he in his translation work that when he was
making his Tamil version of the Holy Scripture it is said
that “he crept through the original Bible text on his
knees as if he was himself a poor sinner or mendicant,
carefully weighing every word to see how it might best be
rendered.” It is a sorrowful fact to record that through
financial speculations in which he was deceived by a
dishonest catechist, poor Fabricius ended under a cloud of
debt which brought scandal on the mission work, and old
and quite weary of life, on the 23rd January, 1791, he
passed to his rest.</p>

<p>As Tanjore will have considerable attention in the
subsequent story of the spread of Christianity in this part
of India, it is only fair to make some reference here to the
earnest native who started the work in these earlier days.
He was an outcast Pariah, by name Rajanaiken, a Roman
Catholic, whose mind was awakened by reading Ziegenbalg’s
translation of the New Testament, and forthwith, with great
courage and devotion, he threw in his lot with the Protestant
missionaries. He gave up his position as an officer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
in the service of the King of Tanjore, became a catechist,
and, though persecuted with vindictive cruelty by the
Jesuit Beschi, he stood faithful. His father was killed
and his two brothers were wounded at his side by the
emissaries of this man, but he was himself spared to do
a good and permanent work among both heathens and
Christians, and died in 1771 at the age of seventy-one.</p>

<p>Thus the work of the Danish Mission, for the first forty
years of the eighteenth century so zealously pursued and
in its later years so generously supported by the S.P.C.K.,
had spread from Tranquebar to Cuddalore and Madras and
to Tanjore in the interior. In many instances the missionaries
rendered great services to the English garrisons,
especially to the foreign levies, for in 1749 an enlistment
of Swiss soldiers made the ministrations of these Danish
and German clergymen very acceptable. These missionaries,
it must be remembered, used the English Prayer
Book or translations of it, taught the Church catechism
in their schools, and in their adult work observed the
ordinance of baptism according to the English rite. In
one of the ancient minutes of the S.P.C.K., dated 4th December,
1744, are the words, “Recommended to ye Missionaries
to continue ye use of ye ch. of Eng. Catechism and
to baptise in ye form of Com. Prayer.”</p>

<p>We have now arrived at a point in the history of these
early missions of Christianity in India at which in the
Providence of God one of the greatest, if not the most
distinguished, of the missionaries of his time appears upon
the scene.</p>

<p class="ph3">FROM COLLEGE TO MISSION FIELD.</p>


<p>In the little town of Sonnenburg, in the Electorate of
Brandenburg, as it was then called, was born on the
8th October, 1726, a little boy, Christian Frederick
Schwartz. Little is known of his home and parents; his
father, however, seems to have occupied a respectable
position in life, and, what is of much more consequence,
he was a devout and godly man. His mother, like so
many of the mothers of missionaries, was a woman of consistent
piety, and her child was from the very threshold
of life dedicated by her to God and His service. She
was not spared to see her son grow up—even in his
boyhood he was motherless—but before she passed away
she solemnly left him to the care of his father and the
pastor of their church, to be trained up like Samuel as
a servant of God, and as her natural and devout ambition
was that he might one day become a minister she made
them promise that they would in every possible way
encourage and help her boy to that end. There is no
evidence to show that these guardians were in any way
unfaithful to this solemn charge. At the early age of
eight years we find the boy a scholar in the principal
Grammar School of his native place, and in Herr Helm,
the rector, he had a guide and adviser who trained his
pupils well. His boys were not only given a good
education, with a special eye to the classics, but they were
taught to pray and commit all their needs to the care of
their Heavenly Father. The boy Schwartz was evidently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
of a thoughtful disposition. Like Henry Martyn he was
wont to steal away from the playground to read a book;
probably his love of retirement at this period was also due
to a lack of the physical robustness of the average school
boy. From his earliest years he had a sensitive soul
which felt instinctively any act of wrong-doing, however
simple it might appear, and he could never rest until in
the solitude of his room or in a walk in the woods he
had poured forth his confession to God and regained the
peace of forgiveness. He seems to have been singularly
fortunate in having a wise and sympathetic teacher in
Herr Helm, and the boy was ripening under his training
when a change came, a new headmaster being
appointed, who perhaps did his part well as an
educationalist, but lacked the moral and religious tone
of his predecessor. None are so quick to catch the change
of temperature in moral training as boys, and the young
Schwartz seems to have soon abandoned many of his
religious habits and grown cold and indifferent towards
higher things. In the ordinary course, however, he was
confirmed with other scholars according to Lutheran
usage at the school, but it is recorded that his preparation
for this solemn occasion was hardly more than superficial
and that the clergyman who performed this office scarcely
impressed this candidate, at any rate, with the necessity
of a real consecration of his heart and life to God. He
partook of Holy Communion with some little religious
emotion but this soon passed away.</p>

<p>The time now came for him to be removed to a better
school, to complete the knowledge of Latin, Greek, and
Hebrew which he had up to a point acquired. Schwartz
was now in his sixteenth year and his father took him to
the adjoining town of Cüstrin, where he might at a more
advanced academy prepare himself for the University
course. It is clear that this wise parent foresaw the risks
which lie in wait for a youth away from home, and as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
walked with his boy, giving him many admonitions, he also
told him that he must exercise self-denial, live a life of
economy and simplicity, fear God, and not forget his
father. He showed his wisdom in giving him only a
limited supply of pocket money, which would at any rate
be a safeguard against luxury and its many temptations,
to which some of his fellow-students soon fell an easy
prey. When he came home for his first vacation his
father took him aside and gave him again some excellent
advice. “My dear Frederick,” he said, “you may
perhaps have sometimes repined on comparing your
homely food and clothing with that of others, and possibly
you may have thought that your father did not love you
so much as the parents of some of your friends, but I
trust that your own good sense and the painful example
of their failure will have led you to perceive my reason
for inuring you to hardships and never encouraging you
to self-indulgence. I may now justly hope that in whatsoever
situation it may please God to place you, you will
be qualified to sustain it.”</p>

<p>We have no clue to the character of his new
headmaster at Cüstrin, but the parish clergyman, named
Stegmann, was undoubtedly an earnest and devout
preacher and awakened in the young student a desire for
spiritual progress. But while outwardly living a life
which did not discredit his father’s counsels and being
diligent and successful in his studies, he had not yet
fulfilled his confirmation vows. To someone who urged
him to be a whole-hearted Christian he excused himself
on the ground that it was difficult, if not impossible, to
be over-religious amid the conditions of life at Cüstrin.
He had yet to learn that in circumstances adverse to a
deep spiritual experience there is the greater and urgent
need for making a definite stand for God. His studies
were, however, interrupted by two severe attacks of
illness, which were not without profit to him, for we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
can generally correct our estimate of the real value of
things from the standpoint of a sick bed. But in the
providence of God the discipline of sickness was assisted
by the kindly interest of a friend. He had been in the
habit of visiting a gentleman who was a man of study,
much respected by the Professors at the Halle University.
The daughter of this good man, a girl of great piety,
became much interested in the young student. She tried
her best to persuade him to commit himself wholly to
the mercy and care of God and lent him books from her
father’s library to help him. One of these greatly took
his fancy; it was the story of the founding of the Orphan
House at Glaucha, near Halle, entitled “Demonstrations
of the Footsteps of a Divine Being yet in the World,”
by that famous divine and philanthropist, Augustus
Hermann Francke. This book much inspired him; the
faith of such a patient and persistent worker, the
difficulties he overcame and the gladness of achievement,
all made a deep impression upon the mind of young
Schwartz. It gave him an increased desire to visit the
scene of such a noble labour and probably awoke in his
heart the first stirrings towards his future life work.
Indeed, on leaving Cüstrin he made his way at once to
Halle with the intention of entering the Grammar School
at the Orphan House. He was being led on step by step.
Before taking this course he was influenced greatly by
the advice of Benjamin Schultze, who, as we have seen,
had recently returned from the Madras Mission invalided.
What communications they had and how far the old
missionary fired the zeal of his young friend we have no
evidence, but this we know, that upon the advice of
Schultze he entered at once the University of Halle, being
now in his twentieth year. His thirst for knowledge was
shown by the way in which he made the most of his
opportunities, attending lectures under his professors,
Baumgarten, Michaelis, Knapp, and Freylinghausen.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
While studying at the University he lived at the Orphan
House and thereby was brought into daily contact with
its venerable founder, Professor Francke, whose influence
over young Schwartz at this time was the means of
bringing him to a decision for Christ and His service.
The fact that he was associated with a University famous
for its missionary interests and also lived in the
atmosphere of godliness at the Orphan House, contributed
to his full determination to devote himself to service in
the foreign field and the well-being of his fellow-men.</p>

<p>He became preceptor in the Latin School of the Orphan
House and it was his duty in that capacity to gather the
scholars and the servants of the establishment together
every morning for family prayers and at the same time to
give them an exposition of some portion of Holy
Scripture. This was also a preparation for his future
sphere of work. The principal of the Orphan House,
G. P. Weiss, took a lively interest in him, and he also
received much benefit from the Divinity lectures delivered
by Dr. Francke, the son of the founder of the work. Here
then, under excellent auspices, he was able to practise
habits of self-denial and thrift and to live that simple
life which was so much impressed upon him by his father.</p>

<p>A special opportunity presented itself after Schwartz
had completed three years of his term at the University.
It was in the mind of the old missionary, Schultze, to
prepare a new and corrected edition of the Holy
Scriptures in the Tamil language, and also a tract in the
same tongue to be sent out for distribution among the
natives of India. Young Schwartz was asked to qualify
himself to help in the preparation of these by studying
Tamil and for some months this new engagement
occupied much of his time. While he was still working
at this the call came for him to devote himself henceforward
to a missionary life and service.</p>

</figcaption>

<p>At this time the work in India was passing through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
anxious times; the French had captured Madras, and
Fabricius was compelled to fly with his little flock,
leaving behind the devastated mission buildings. But
afterwards, when the British troops had turned the tide
of war, the Lutheran missionary was invited to take
charge of the church buildings at Vepery, from which
the Romanists had been ejected for their treason. The
call for fresh helpers was urgent and Fabricius pleaded
for reinforcements. In response Professor Francke was
asked to select some fit men in the University to go out
and take up this work, and it is not surprising that
Schwartz should have been selected and recommended.
He was evidently prepared for this and readily consented,
but stipulated that his father’s permission must be
obtained. After much prayer, for he felt the turning
point in his life had come, Schwartz hastened homeward
to his native Sonnenburg. At first his reception was by
no means favourable. He was the eldest son, and the
whole family were looking forward to his advancement
as a Lutheran clergyman at home, and even his father
quite naturally hoped that, as he was getting into years,
this worthy son of his would take his proper place as
head of the family. It was a crisis, one which has
occurred in the life of many a young missionary on the
threshold of his career of divine service. At such a time
we often extend to the young son a deep sympathy, which,
however, in justice ought to be shared with his parent. In
the case of Schwartz’s father, the decision involved so much
that he took three days to consider his duty, and when
this time of waiting had expired the family expected
that their own views on the subject would be promptly
confirmed. But the old man had taken counsel of God,
and he was ready, like Abraham, to make any sacrifice
in obedience thereto. He came downstairs and laid his
hand upon the shoulder of his expectant son, bidding him
God-speed and granting him his blessing and approval,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
asking him never to forget his own country and his
father’s house, but to go in God’s name to win many souls
for Christ. The brave old man little thought how much
he was giving for the welfare of the world.</p>

<p>The young man had made his resolve, his father’s
blessing had been obtained, and he forthwith burnt his
boats by handing over to his brothers and sisters the
portion which would have fallen to him, and hastened
back to Halle with a light heart, full of thankfulness for
the past and plans for the future. His choice was soon
tested by the offer of a lucrative appointment in the
ministry of his Church at home, but his mind was fully
made up and henceforward his face was steadfastly set
towards the foreign mission field. The claims of India
were laid upon his heart, and he longed to be going where
he felt sure God had called him. Two other young men
had also been selected for the work by Dr. Francke;
David Poltzenhagen of Willin in Pomerania, and George
Henry Hüttemann of Minden in Westphalia. On the
8th August, 1749, the three arrived at Copenhagen to
receive Holy Orders. A month later they were prepared
for this sacred office by the counsels and instruction of Dr.
Hersleb, Bishop of Zealand and Primate of Denmark, and
in due time, on the 17th September, they were ordained
by Bishop Horreboa to the office of ministers. It only
remained for them to bid farewell to their families and
friends, and Schwartz parted from his aged father, never
to see his face again, and received many good wishes from
the old comrades and professors at Halle University. It
was thought better for the party to go to India by an
English vessel, so they embarked at Helvoetsluys and
arrived at Harwich on the 6th December, 1749, and so
on through Colchester to London. Their stay in the
great city was only about six weeks and they were
comfortably lodged in Kensington. From the Society for
Promoting Christian Knowledge the young missionaries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
received a hearty welcome, and every possible arrangement
for their comfort and travelling requirements was
made by that Society. In the Royal chaplain, the Rev.
W. Ziegenhagen, they found a wise and helpful friend,
and one of the pleasant memories which Schwartz carried
away with him from our English shores was the kindness
which he and the other out-going missionaries received
from this good man. They were able to get a little
practice in English during their stay and also had the
opportunity of preaching in our pulpits. Arrangements
were made for them to embark on the “Lynn” under
Captain Egerton, the directors of the East India
Company having kindly granted them a free passage.
Writing from Deal, where he was awaiting the
vessel’s arrival, Schwartz expresses his grateful thanks
in a letter written to Dr. Francke on 24th February,
1750, and also in another previously written from Kensington
on the 18th of the preceding month. The following
extracts in the order in which they were penned, are
full of interest:</p>

<p>“God hath ordered all things well on the voyage. Our
hearts (more especially mine) were very cheerful during
the storming and raging of the sea; and I have frequently
reminded myself of the 46th Psalm with great joy. Praised
be God! This ought to be the beginning, middle and end
of my letter. If God maketh this only to resound in our
hearts, that the Jehovah, our sun and shield, is with us, we
can then not only be tranquil but cheerful.</p>

<p>“Our occupations here have been of singular use and
a great refreshment to us. In every difficulty we could
have recourse to the Rev. Mr. Ziegenhagen, the venerable
chaplain of His Majesty, who has behaved to us with
paternal kindness and has given us such plain directions
as we, like inexperienced children, stood in need of.
This was our daily occupation, to take lessons and receive
instructions. Then we had also to preach a few sermons;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
I twice, namely, once in the Royal Chapel on the first
day of Nativity and afterwards for the Rev. Mr. Pittins
at the Savoy; Mr. Poltzenhagen four times and Mr.
Hüttemann three. May God bless what has been spoken
in great weakness.”</p>

<p>And now from Deal:</p>

<p>“The 10th of January, according to the old style,
which is yet used here, or the 21st according to the new,
was the day on which we left Kensington, where God
bestowed so much grace upon us. On the preceding
evening we were from seven till ten with His Majesty’s
chaplain, who said many things to the awakening of our
hearts. He gave us the 121st Psalm for meditation on
our voyage, ‘I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from
whence cometh my help’. Whatever could in any way
constitute to our comfort and encouragement, that he
did. On New Year’s Day also he addressed us publicly
from the pulpit from these words, ‘Be not afraid, only
believe’ (Mark v. 36). At the same time he exhorted
the congregation to pray for us. On the same evening
he prayed again with us, commended us to the mercy
of God and gave us some copies of his lately published
‘Exposition of the Lord’s Prayer’. He then dismissed us
with the cordial admonition not to allow our brotherly
love to cool. May God write all that we have heard
deeply in our hearts!</p>

<p>“Thus we departed on the 21st January, N.S., in the
Name of Jesus, accompanied by that trusty German,
Matthieson, who has conducted all the missionaries from
Mr. Walther until now. On the 23rd we arrived at Deal,
in perfect health and spirits. Here we lodged in a house
which is only a few paces from the shore, so that from
our windows we see nothing but the sea. My heart is
filled with cheerful confidence, being convinced that as
God has taken us under His paternal care during our
late travels so will He likewise continue to be our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
Protector. If we will only cleave steadfastly to Him,
He will most certainly be with us and be our faithful
God. And He will graciously hear the prayers with
which we know so many of His children and servants
accompany us. Now, therefore, we go forth in the Name
of the Lord Who hath called us to be His servants and
messengers among the heathen, Who will also guide and
bring us to the destined place.”</p>

<p>A few days more and the ship, with her three
missionary passengers, stood out to sea. Not yet out of
sight of land, they would watch the lessening shores and
hills of England as they sailed down channel. Some
favourable winds had sprung up, but they could not take
advantage of them because the boat which was to victual
the ship for their long voyage had not arrived. So they
lay off the Isle of Wight, and Schwartz takes advantage
of the delay to send some very interesting details in
letters to his friend, the Chaplain Ziegenhagen, under
dates 1st and 3rd February, 1750.</p>

<p>“There comes a ship to bring us provisions by which
I send you a few lines. On the 29th of January we left
Deal. God hath given us a favourable wind, with
which we have already sailed past Portsmouth. Praised
be His name we are all well. Our cabin is below that
of the captain. We are alone, for which we have
thankfully to acknowledge the goodness of God. We
are as conveniently accommodated as can be expected on
board ship. God be praised for it! The captain is a
good, plain dealing man, and the other passengers show
us much kindness. We talk English as yet very badly
but they all encourage us to speak and no one laughs
at our blunders. Several of them know a little Latin
and use their utmost endeavours to explain to us
whatever we do not understand. We return hearty
thanks to God for having brought us to this ship.
Hitherto He hath graciously preserved us, that no one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
has sustained any hurt, except that last night a sailor
fell into the water; however, he was saved. The
number of persons on board is about a hundred and a
few passengers. We pass our time in reading the Holy
Scriptures in the original language and other good books,
and practise reading and writing English, according to
your kind instruction. There are persons on board who
go to India for pleasure. One of them goes for the fifth
time and says it is a very pleasant voyage. There are
also many children on board who learn navigation. Now
this I have written in haste. May Jesus bless you
abundantly and hear your prayers and those of other
children and servants of God for us! O the Lord is
faithful and never yet forsook His people.”</p>

<p>The delay in receiving the expected provisions kept
them back and we find Schwartz again sending a few
more lines to his friend in England.</p>

<p>“Filial love requires us to make use of this opportunity
of informing you of our circumstances. When we last
wrote to you we were off the Isle of Wight and had a
most favourable wind but we were obliged to lay to for
more than half a day, before the things which the ship
brought us from Deal were taken on board. Towards
evening we sailed and by Monday came already close to
the Bay of Biscay. In the morning the wind veered
about and the captain found himself compelled to return
to some harbour. Here the motion of the ship was so
violent that I experienced something of sea sickness but
only for a few minutes. That day about four we arrived
off Falmouth. We were met by two pilots and the captain
engaged him who came first to the ship, but the other,
on coming up, expressed his great dissatisfaction, not so
much because he had not been engaged, as because the
other had not conducted us aright. He disputed so long
that the first was obliged to go away. This morning we
found that the man had just grounds for his displeasure.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
For when it was ebb tide our ship had not sufficient
water but struck frequently against the ground with such
a crash as if a gun was fired. At the same time there
was a great storm so that we might have sustained much
injury if God had not preserved us. Now we praise Him
that we were forced to return, for in this storm we should
have been in the greatest danger off the Spanish coast.
Thus we daily perceive that His goodness preserves us.
O that we might always look only to Him, rest in His
will and filially resign ourselves to it! Our captain shows
us great kindness. For the rest I pray God daily that
He would purify my heart more and more from all dross
and by His Spirit fit me for the important office for which,
unworthy as I am, He has out of mere grace ordained
me.”</p>

<p>They appear to have been weatherbound at Falmouth
for over a month but the delay was not lost upon Schwartz
and his colleagues. They had a little unexpected quiet in
which to prosecute their studies, and, as will be seen by
the letter which Schwartz wrote on their arrival at
Tranquebar, they were enabled to keep in touch with
England a little longer and felt the pulse of that throbbing
wave of revival of religion which under the Wesleys and
Whitefield was passing over the people. It is evident that
during their brief stay in London this had not affected
them; being so much in the company of the Royal
chaplain, and not having time or inclination to visit any
parts of the country, they had missed this stimulus to
their faith. But in the little world of their life on board
during this long voyage of four months from their leaving
the shelter of Falmouth Harbour, they had many
experiences to record, which awakened a spirit of
thankfulness, and as this was the first time they had made
a voyage the incidents related by Schwartz in his letter
of 8th October, 1750, are well worth preserving. They
give us a side light of his character and how step by step<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
and day by day God was preparing him for the great work
which was awaiting him at Tranquebar.</p>

<p>“We can now,” says he, “joyfully relate how
graciously God hath heard your supplications in His
goodness to us. With undeserved grace and mercy He
hath brought us, hath graciously averted all perils on our
long voyage, mightily refreshed us during the course of
it both in soul and body, and caused us to reach the end of
it in four months and four days. We could scarcely have
imagined that He would so paternally and graciously
guide us. His Name be humbly praised and glorified now
and in eternity!</p>

<p>“In order to give you, reverend Sir, a somewhat
detailed account of this gracious guidance of our God,
that you may magnify His name with us, I shall briefly
relate the most important particulars from our diary, not
having yet found time to copy the diary itself, which your
Reverence will kindly excuse.</p>

<p>“How God conducted us into Falmouth Harbour and
what we there noticed to His praise, you will have observed
from the short letter which we wrote on the day of our
departure. On the 12th March God gave us a good wind,
and everything was prepared for sailing. But the tide
being then at ebb, we were obliged to wait till the evening
as we could not otherwise get safely out of the harbour.
In the afternoon an inhabitant of the town came on board
who had been powerfully awakened by Mr Whitefield.
This man related to us many things, particularly of the
minister of Falmouth—how zealous he was in the
discharge of his duty. We regretted that we had not
visited him, but as the stranger intimated that he would
salute him from us we sent the minister Professor
Zimmermann’s treatise on the Excellency of the Knowledge
of Christ, translated into Latin, in which we wrote a few
lines.</p>

<p>“About seven in the evening we sailed, in the name<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
of God, out of the harbour, with a man-of-war, which we
thought was to escort us, but the next day we learned that
she was to escort the ‘Norfolk.’ With this Divine
dispensation we were well satisfied, believing that we
should not need that convoy if we could only say with
David (Psalm xlvi. 7): ‘The Lord of Hosts is with
us, the God of Jacob is our refuge.’ If the Lord be for
us who or what can be against us? We met a Dutch
ship from Smyrna to Rotterdam, the captain of which
informed us that he had suffered much from the late
severe storms, whilst we were quietly in the harbour. On
the 16th we were met by two ships which exhibited a
sad spectacle. One of them had sprung a large leak and
drew several feet of water, so that she lay very deep and
rolled from side to side. Our captain backed the sails
and sent the carpenter with an officer and some others
to see whether they could assist, but on their return they
declared that the vessel must sink. The other ship
therefore kept quite close to the damaged one that the
people might save themselves.”</p>

<p>The health of Schwartz had by this time been
re-established and, although subject to the delicacy which
is common to people of sedentary habit who have not
developed their physical capacities by exercise, the young
missionary appears to have started his voyage without
much discomfort except a little sea-sickness. But we
find him suddenly laid aside.</p>

<p>“On the 21st March I had a fever, which continued
till the 10th April. As I fell away so much the doctor
was alarmed, but God helped me graciously and soon
restored me my bodily health. I must also confess to
His praise that this sickness has been of great service to
me. On the 22nd March we had for the first time Divine
service on board our ship, which afforded us great pleasure.
On the 29th we passed the tropic of Cancer and on the
18th April we crossed the line for the first time. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
was great joy on board that we had not been detained
longer. On the 22nd we were in the bight of Ascension.
The 30th God visibly preserved a youth from death, who
had entered on board to learn navigation. A thick cable
fell down from above, exactly on the spot where he was
standing but before it reached him he perceived it and
narrowly escaped. Towards evening a ship was seen.
We rejoiced at first, hoping for an opportunity of sending
letters, but our joy had nearly been changed to fear, as
our people began to think that they might be enemies
and made preparations for defence. Early next morning
we looked out for her but in vain. On the 5th May we
passed the tropic of Capricorn and thus left the torrid
zone. As soon as the trade wind ceased we were favoured
with a delightful breeze from E.N.E. If we attend to
the different changes of wind, we may observe agreeable
traces of the admirable wisdom of God. On the 7th we
saw a French vessel and on our captain firing a signal
gun, to desire them to wait, they did so and we came
up with her towards evening. The captains conversed
with each other on their observations and ours agreed
pretty well with theirs. It was a great advantage that
we could observe so well in our ship for even in hazy
weather the sun appeared a little about noon. The
chief mate requested us to communicate the observations
contained in our diaries, particularly with regard to the
variation of the compass. We did so and he gratefully
acknowledged it by giving us a fine large Cheshire cheese.
The 11th May we had a very high wind, and the next
day a calm. While we spoke of it in the evening and
sighed to God that He would have pity on us, as before,
suddenly there arose a very favourable breeze. Thus
God fulfilled us what He had promised—‘Before they call
I will answer and while they are yet speaking I will
hear.’ So that we could praise God with joyful hearts.
On the 17th May we celebrated the Feast of Pentecost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
and heartily besought God that by His Spirit, whom
Jesus has obtained, He would fit us for the important
office to which He has called us. The 12th May our
dear brother Hüttemann was seized with alarming
sickness but God most graciously blessed the use of the
medicines out of the travelling chest which you gave us,
so that he was fully restored to us in a few days. On
the 23rd we had an unusually brisk gale, the vessel
inclined so much that it shipped water which we had not
hitherto seen. However, it passed over without damage.
On the 27th we had a complete calm so that the captain
and the chief mate went out in a boat to shoot birds,
but on the following night arose a real storm, which, as
it came unexpectedly, tore all the sails. When we came
upon deck in the morning they all hung in rags, and
we had only one small sail hoisted. We did not, however,
yield to anxious or desponding thoughts. So faithful
is God! In need He refresheth and comforteth
abundantly. The 30th May we had very pleasant weather,
which was a great relief after the storm. On the 31st
we saw a Dutch ship. We all wished it might approach
us but were disappointed as it passed us at a considerable
distance, but in the afternoon our joy was greater, as
we caught sight of the Cape. The mountains presented
themselves at a distance like clouds, but as we came nearer
we could see them distinctly. We praised God heartily,
the more so as we had on this very day been powerfully
impressed in meditating on the words (1 Cor. xv. 58):
‘Therefore, my blessed brethren, be ye steadfast,
unmoveable, always abounding in the Work of the Lord,
forasmuch as ye know that your labour shall not be in
vain in the Lord.’”</p>

<p>From these incidents recorded by Schwartz it is easy
to recall the difficulties of navigation at a time when
the ship was absolutely dependent upon the winds and
tides. These fine old East Indiamen vessels, which were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
far more picturesque than are the steamships of to-day, had
in his time the double risk to contend with of great and
fierce storms in the eastern seas and the prospect of
capture, or at any rate injury, by the French Navy, with
which nation we were then at war. For these and other
reasons the missionaries began to hope anxiously for their
journey’s end.</p>

<p>“From this time we began to look out for India, and
thought we had now left the worst behind. But on the
17th June, in the night, we had a most furious storm,
in which all declared we were in great danger. Even
the next day it was frightful to behold and it was much
heightened by the heavy rain which accompanied the
wind. Meanwhile, when the tempest was at the highest,
we slept in peace and quiet, a gracious God had hidden
the danger from us. On the 19th there was a pretty
strong breeze. A rope, with which a sail was belayed,
happened to break, which caused the ship to heel a little,
and all at once we lay on our side. The captain called
out to the man at the helm to put the ship about, but
they could not accomplish it. The vessel had inclined
altogether to one side, and was, moreover, quite wet from
the rain, so that the people fell as they attempted to walk
on the deck. However, the storm at length subsided and
we sustained no material injury. In how many
distresses hath not our gracious God covered us, as it
were, with His wings! On the 30th of June we passed
the tropic of Capricorn a second time. Now we came again
into a pleasant climate, hitherto we had sometimes very
cold weather. On the 4th July the rope of the helm
broke, and as the wind happened to blow fresh, the ship
fell into some disorder. On the 10th we again crossed
the line. The 13th was a most agreeable day for we
then came in sight of Ceylon. The chief mate discovered
it about nine in the morning. The joy which this
produced on board is hardly to be described, since the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
greater number scarcely expected that we should make it
so directly. We said, ‘This hath God done! O how
great is His goodness and how graciously doth He hear
our prayers! May the kindness which He hath showed
us in this instance serve to strengthen us in filial
confidence!’</p>

<p>“This day and the following we enjoyed the
delightful smell of cinnamon. At the same time we had
a most favourable wind so that during the day we passed
at a good distance by the rocks of Ceylon. On the 16th
of July we were approaching the coast of Coromandel;
everyone therefore looked out eagerly for land but the
night drew on and we could see none. About nine we
found a bottom at fifteen fathoms, and it was remarkable
that as soon as it was found, the wind ceased. We
therefore dropped the anchor. In the morning when we
looked out, we not only beheld the coast but found
ourselves right opposite to Cuddalore. We praised the
name of the Lord for this paternal guidance, and
whosoever delights in the traces of His gracious
providence will, on hearing it, exalt His name together.</p>

<p>“After we had cast anchor the natives immediately
came on board. The sight of these poor people, who sit
in darkness and the shadow of death, deeply affected our
hearts, and we awakened ourselves cheerfully to work at
their conversion and to recommend to them the salvation
of the Gospel. Now the Lord vouchsafe to give us
wisdom, grace, and strength to accomplish this purpose,
since we are most unworthy to be unto them ‘a savour
of life unto life.’</p>

<p>“We informed the Rev. Mr. Kiernander of our arrival
and he sent in the afternoon a country boat to fetch us.
There we took our leave of the officers and passengers
who had shown us every kindness. They were much
moved at parting and wished us every blessing in our
future ministry. May the Lord do good abundantly to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
them all! In the evening dear Mr. Kiernander received
us and praised the name of the Lord for all the mercy
He had shown us....</p>

<p>“On the 24th of July the Rev. Senior of the Danish
missionaries, Mr. Wiedebroeck, came from Tranquebar to
fetch us. He joined us in hearty praises to God for all
His mercies. After having therefore visited several
English gentlemen, we departed on the 28th from
Cuddalore. Dear Mr. Kiernander accompanied us as far
as the first river and there took leave of us. On the
30th we arrived at Tranquebar in perfect health and were
most paternally received by our dear brethren. Now
hitherto the Lord hath helped us. To Him be glory for
ever and ever.”</p>

<p>It is not recorded in this letter, but it is worthy of
note, that the vessel from which they were landed at
Cuddalore was quite shipwrecked on her departure at the
mouth of the river.</p>

<p>Schwartz was now at what he had called the destined
end of his travels and the appointed beginning of his life
work. He saw at once that a knowledge of Tamil was
the first necessity of his work, and, therefore, with a
native catechist who could also speak German, he
laboured hard to qualify himself. So successful was he
that in less than four months after his arrival in India
he was able to preach his first sermon in Tamil from
Matthew xi. 25-30, with its true missionary appeal.
“Come unto me, all ye that labour end are heavy laden,
and I will give you rest,” in the New Jerusalem Church
where Ziegenbalg used to preach. It was his first word
for his Master and Lord, possibly uttered with much
humility and some misgivings of his own fitness but full
of the abundant grace which is ready to fulfil the promise
to every creature. Of this discourse some brief outlines
are preserved. It was a very earnest appeal to these
people, facing him for the first time with their dark faces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
and hearts full of shadows from superstition and
ignorance. He began at once by pointing out the one
and only hope for humanity and begged them to take
advantage of the gracious offer of salvation. This was
the key note of his life work, and it has been well
pointed out that in an age when theological controversies
and contention were the characteristic of the Church, it
is a cheering fact that the faith of Schwartz preserved
its simplicity, and that he preached the great essential
verities of the Evangel of God to a sinful world.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">IN TOUCH WITH THE BRAHMINS.</p>


<p>The early experiences of a missionary on arriving in his
field of work abroad will sometimes dissipate a little of
the romance which fancy had gathered about his outlook,
and will instead reveal quite unexpected difficulties to
try his faith, forcing him to a fuller dependence on God.
On the other hand, all that is best in him of inspiration
and devotion is deepened by the fact of his seeing as
never before the unutterable need of his message and
recognising his clear call to give that in the name of his
Master. And seeing that the highest summits of success
can only be attained by simple and persevering steps,
he will apply himself with prayerful fidelity to these
necessary details of his new position. His call was
instant, his fitness for it must be attained by hard work
and patient application.</p>

<p>All this was true of Schwartz. He faced the difficulty
of language, seeing that unless he could speak to the
people in their own tongue it was of no use his coming
so far to be a missionary in India. It will be seen that
he found that from the native children there was much
to be learnt in this direction, and his easy access to their
hearts, for he was particularly fond of young people, was
very useful as an open door to future usefulness. Not
only did he exercise his gift as a linguist in gaining a
knowledge of the native languages, but he learnt
Portuguese, because amongst his hearers were many of
that nationality. It was also his aim to know not only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
the language but the people themselves, to know how they
lived, what were their difficulties, and as regards their
present religion how they stood in respect to Christianity.
He began his work with an unshaken confidence in his
right and authority to be where he was and do the will
of his God according to his abilities. On this point, from
the very beginning, he never had a shadow of doubt.
Very humbly and sincerely he wrote: “It is a sweet
comfort to my heart that I am enabled to say, ‘It is thou,
O my God, who hast conducted me to these parts, I have
not run hither of my own accord but would rather have
declined the call, if Thine unseen hand had not retained
me. O therefore help and bestow upon me all necessary
wisdom, grace, and strength for this office!’</p>

<p>“My gracious God has already manifested so many
proofs of His paternal love towards me that I cannot but
remember the word of the Lord Jesus which He spoke to
upright Nathanael, ‘Thou shalt see greater things than
these.’ May the Lord give me grace that like Nathanael
I may use the proofs of divine goodness and mercy which
I have hitherto experienced, and as a solid foundation and
confirmation of my faith. If henceforth I do not behold
the glory of God then verily unbelief will be the cause
of it. At Nazareth my Saviour did not many mighty
works because of their unbelief. Now Lord grant faith,
and that <i>lively</i> faith!...</p>

<p>“I humbly praise God that during the year I have
been here He, notwithstanding all my imperfections,
hath borne with me with great patience and forbearance;
hath been daily nigh unto my soul and hath kindly
refreshed me. If I have not had the same enjoyments
daily, the fault was on my own side. Now this goodness,
long suffering and patience of our Lord, I shall account
my Salvation, according to St. Peter’s exhortation.</p>

<p>“As to external things, God has given me life and
health and has made the climate and the heat supportable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
so that though my breathing was sometimes oppressive
yet I have not been induced to complain. Praised be His
name also for this special help! Whoever always reposes
in the good and holy will of God saves himself much
trouble, and makes that supportable which an impatient
and unsubdued self-will renders intolerable. May the
Lord subdue this self-will more and more by the power
of the Cross of Christ!”</p>

<p>He looks back with thankfulness on his Tamil studies
at the University of Halle. He discovers that after
preaching in that language conversation becomes much
easier. He starts a catechetical class in the Tamil or
Malabar School and “with the youngest lambs, I thus
learned to stammer.” From time to time he makes
excursions into the district round Tranquebar and
discusses points of doctrine and difficulty which are
presented to him by inquirers. Here we see the tact of
Schwartz, his readiness to reply to any question, and at
the same time, while giving a clear statement of the claims
of the Gospel, he would not offend or hurt the religious
feelings of his listeners. It was also necessary to
exercise great care in testing the reality and sincerity
of those who presented themselves for baptism. Schwartz
was not satisfied with a superficial adhesion to the
Christian faith; he felt that the work would be hindered
so much by the instability or inconsistency of those
professing Christianity. While much of his work lay
among the lowest caste natives, he frequently met and
conversed with thoughtful and inquiring Hindus of the
higher grade.</p>

<p>One day one of these, a Hindu merchant, said to him:
“God has created us to the end that we should know
and serve Him.” This simple and accurate proposition
was of course agreed to by Schwartz, but he added that
unfortunately, although God had given him and many
of his countrymen a knowledge of the end of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
creation, yet they remained in idolatry and thus
unhappily never attained to it. After this he pointed out
how Christ had come to reveal the will of God and
Himself as the way, the truth, and the life to all sinners.</p>

<p>But then, to a far greater extent than now, the
difficulty in the minds of unbelievers was the inconsistent
lives and character of professing Christians. The
European population was by no means a good example of
what the Christian religion did for a man; of course, in
many cases the difficulty arose from the common mistake
of supposing that because a man had a white face and came
from a Christian country he was necessarily himself a
Christian. A wealthy native merchant who was growing
old and could speak in Danish, English, and French, came
with this respectful inquiry—“Sir, be not displeased, I
wish to ask you a question. Do all Europeans speak like
you?” To this Schwartz made answer that all
Europeans were unfortunately not true Christians, but
there were many amongst them who were sincere and
real in their belief in Christ, and these prayed for the
conversion of the Hindus. This was, however, a surprise
to this honest and venerable inquirer, and he frankly
expressed his opinion of the Christians with whom he had
met, who at any rate were Europeans: “You astonish
me, for from what we daily observe and experience we
cannot but think them, with very few exceptions, to be
self-interested, incontinent, proud, full of illiberal
contempt and prejudice against us Hindus and even
against their own religion, especially the higher classes.
So at least I have found it with the majority of those with
whom I have had any intercourse.” Still more plainly
did the girl pupil of a Hindu dancing master retort when
Schwartz told them that no wicked and unholy person
could possibly enter the Kingdom of heaven. “Alas,
sir,” she cried bitterly, “in that case hardly any
European will ever enter it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>In some cases the discussion of Christianity revealed
the philosophic and alert mind of the Hindu. Schwartz
had one day been preaching the Gospel when a Hindu
raised the point with him that he and others in India
really worshipped the same God as the Christians only
they gave him another name. To this argument
Schwartz replied:</p>

<p>“The true God must possess Divine perfections, such
as supreme wisdom, omniscience, omnipotence, holiness,
justice. Now nothing of this is found in your divinities,
but by your own records, ignorance, impurity, cruelty.
How can it be said of such that they are gods? You
have a proverb that where sin is, there is no excellence.
Now you acknowledge the practices ascribed to your gods
to be sinful; consequently by your own confession they
are unworthy of the name.”</p>

<p>“That is very true,” replied the Hindu, “but if we
receive even what is false and think it to be true in our
heart, it is done to us according to our faith.”</p>

<p>“How can you adopt,” said Schwartz, “a sophism
which you yourselves on other occasions reject? You are
accustomed to say, ‘if one writes the word sugar and then
licks his finger, it will not on that account become sweet,
though he believe it ever so firmly.’”</p>

<p>Here is a striking statement made by another to the
missionary one day—it is the unbelief of a later day in
its old setting. We can imagine Schwartz, with his keen
intellect, watching this caviller as he tries to throw the
net of a fine spun objection upon the teaching of the
missionary.</p>

<p>“I am surprised to hear you say,” urged this clever
Hindu, “that if we forsake Paganism our souls will be
happy and that if we do not God will punish us. What
is the soul? A breath which when it has left the body
is blown away with other winds. You may perceive this
by holding the hand to a dying person’s mouth to feel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
whether there is yet breath. If there be, life is still in
him. Thus breath and the soul are one and the same
thing. Who then can say that wind shall be punished?
What is God? Can He be seen? He is the universe. I
die—that means nothing more than that my body is
resolved into its original elements—water, fire, earth, air.
But the existence of such a spirit within me as you speak
of, I believe not. Where is it when I sleep, when I see
no one, or though one touch me I do not feel it?”</p>

<p>Schwartz quietly and with careful reasoning strove to
put him right. He felt he was dealing with the problem
of the soul in every age, in every country, his own as well
as under an Indian sky, the questionings of a spirit wanting,
perhaps, behind all its cavillings, to find the truth,
at any rate feeling its need of direction, but ignoring the
only key, the only guiding hand. He spoke to this Hindu
of the operations of the soul, such as thinking, judging,
determining, and asked whether mind was capable of
these. Then lifting his thought to a higher plane he
pointed out the arguments for the existence of a soul, how
this constituted his immortal part and personality, which
being endowed with understanding and will can act for
itself and knows the fluctuations of sorrow, anxiety, and
pain, as well as joy and satisfaction. Then he opened to
him the Scriptures and showed him from St. Paul’s
Epistle to the Corinthians the doctrine of the resurrection
from the dead. It will be seen how Schwartz drew his
strength from the Bible—the book he loved—which was
the power and inspiration behind all his soul.</p>

<p>His readiness to answer questions and the pleasant
welcome he gave to all inquirers attracted to his side
many who had been set thinking by his words. It is
remarkable how the fit word was given him.</p>

<p>“If I become a Christian,” asked one of the natives
standing by, “how shall I be maintained?” A
justifiable question in India where the profession of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
faith meant so much loss. Schwartz replied, “Work
and pray,” handing to the man the open Gospel of St.
Matthew in Tamil, and the words upon which his eyes
lighted were from the sixth chapter and verses thirty-one
to thirty-three: “Take no thought, saying, what
shall we eat and what shall we drink, or wherewithal
shall we be clothed? For after all these things do the
Gentiles seek, for your Heavenly Father knoweth that
you have need of all these things. But seek ye first the
Kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these
things shall be added unto you.”</p>

<p>About this time he received tidings of serious reverses
which had befallen his home at Sonnenburg. A
disastrous fire which had broken out in the little town
had burnt down his father’s house and in his letter of
the 8th October, 1753, he expresses his desire to help
all he can. Although so far away he is anxious to sustain
his father in these new difficulties.</p>

<p>“I have been thinking,” he writes, “of some means
of performing my duty as a son, in sending home some
little assistance. I have a watch given me in England
and request that you will sell it to some watchmaker and
send the proceeds to my father.”</p>

<p>The capacity which Schwartz displayed and his
increasing influence amongst the converts as well as upon
the natives who gathered to listen to his message so
impressed the brethren of the mission that they gladly
handed over to him the oversight of the branches and
schools south of the river Cavery. This entailed upon
him a good deal of travelling, and on one occasion he
went with his colleague, Mr. Kohlhoff, to visit Cuddalore.
The journey had to be made on foot, and when they
rested their time was occupied in reading the Hebrew
Psalms to each other and whenever opportunity offered
they preached the Gospel to the crowds which gathered
round. In some cases the message was not well received,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
as when their boatmen who were taking them across the
Coleroon refused to hear what they had to say about
Christianity. But pulling up by a wood the party got
out of the boat and soon found a number of Hindus,
Mohammedans and a Roman Catholic native to whom
they preached, and the Romanist afterwards spoke to
them in private, asking for advice and instruction. It
was then the practice to punish a man guilty of stealing
by cutting off a limb and one of these mutilated robbers
came to Schwartz and begged for a plaster to heal the
wound where his foot had been amputated. This help
was given him, but while his bodily pain was being
treated he was directed to the great Physician who was
alone able to save his soul. One man said, as a tract was
offered him, “We follow our rulers.” “Then,” replied
the missionary, “follow God, He is the Supreme Ruler
of us all.”</p>

<p>When they arrived at Cuddalore the brethren in the
mission received them with thankfulness, and during
their short stay they took part in the weekly conference
which was founded by Ziegenbalg. He had established it
upon lines of simple and practical wisdom with these
words:</p>

<p>“The weekly conference which we hold every Friday
with all the labourers is of the greatest utility in keeping
the mission work in order. For on that day, in the
forenoon, we pray to God for wisdom and counsel and each
relates how he has been employed or what has occurred
in the congregations and schools and in the printing and
bookbinding offices and in the private houses. Here
everything that might occasion disorder or detriment is
adjusted and those means are adopted which may best
promote the general good. The conference being over
the Portuguese and Tamil assistants make a report of
their labours and of whatever may be wanting, that as
far as possible it may be supplied.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>It is interesting to note that this excellent arrangement
continued for about a hundred years after the death of
Ziegenbalg, a testimony to his wise administration. In
addition to this meeting Schwartz held what they called
a “colloquium biblicum,” reading together those striking
verses in the tenth chapter of the Acts of the Apostles
where St. Peter declares the great missionary mandate
that “God is no respecter of persons but in every nation
he that feareth Him and worketh righteousness is
accepted with Him.” There was something very
Apostolic about the visit of Schwartz and his companion
to this mission station, the gatherings together for
prayer and exposition of the Scriptures, the gracious
influence which broke down all barriers and cheered every
heart in mutual love, then finally the solemn covenant
before God to bear one another’s burdens and preach the
Gospel to the heathen around. Schwartz with his hands
outstretched gave them his blessing: “Now the Lord has
heard what we have spoken before Him. May He give us
life, strength, and prosperity!”</p>

<p>The brethren accompany their visitors a little way on
their road back and then bid them farewell.</p>

<p>They journey homewards with thankful spirits for all
they have seen and been permitted to do and in due
time come within sight of Tranquebar, where one of the
brethren hastens forward to bid them welcome home. As
they get near to the mission house the Tamil school
children come slowly forward singing the metrical version
of Ecclesiasticus l. 22-24: “Now let us praise the
Lord,” their sweet childish voices bringing a smile to
the faces of the returning missionaries. Then the other
brethren come forward and the Danish soldiers stationed
at the place join in the welcome. Schwartz lifts up his
voice in prayer and praise.</p>

<p>“Praised be Thy name, O Lord, in profound humility,
for all the grace, protection, and blessing during the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
whole of our journey Thou hast graciously bestowed upon
us of Thine undeserved mercy for the sake of Christ, our
Mediator! May the seed of Thy word, which we Thy
poor servants have sowed on our journey, spring up and
produce abundant fruits that we and those who have
received the word in their hearts, may praise and adore
Thy goodness to all eternity! May the mission with our
brethren at Cuddalore, which has been renewed afresh in
Thy sacred presence, be productive of abundant blessing!
Our supplications, which we have jointly brought before
Thy footstool, with regard to ourselves and the flock
entrusted to us, vouchsafe graciously to hear and let us
perceive it for the strengthening of our faith. And thus
begin anew to bless us and to prosper the work of our
hands. Yes, prosper thou our handiwork, O Lord, for
the sake of Christ and of His bitter sufferings and death!
Amen.”</p>

<p class="ph3">AMID WAR’S ALARMS.</p>


<p>During these early days of the mission of Schwartz, in
the middle of the eighteenth century, while he was
peacefully preaching the Gospel and instructing the native
children, the fate of India in the struggle of conquest
was being sealed. Doubtless there came to his ears the
distant alarms of war. Rival Rajahs fought against
each other for supremacy, and it taxed the utmost tact,
diplomacy, and resources of the Company to hold their
own, when a new element of disorder appeared in the
person of the French General Dupleix, which threatened
the very existence of the English in that land. Securing
powerful allies among the native chieftains he carried all
before him, with his military genius and valour. But
another star was arriving, and Clive, still more brilliant
and not less brave, fought the French and beat them,
saving India by the splendid defence of Arcot and the
victory of Plassey.</p>

<p>Honours were freely bestowed upon him, for he was
statesman as well as warrior, and in the history of India
his name will never die. But the fate of Dupleix was
far different. Battling against failure and seeking to
retrieve the fortunes of his flag he was ignominiously
recalled by his ungrateful country and died in direst
poverty of a broken heart.</p>

<p>These were then some of the darkest days of Indian
history, the time of the tragedy of the Black Hole of
Calcutta, of wanton treachery, of pitiless hate and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
massacre, and all the miseries of a bloody war. In the
midst of these stormy conflicts, Schwartz was much
concerned with the indifference which existed in the minds
of the natives towards the claims of the Christian religion.
Thankful as he felt for the marks of success on many
hands, he realized increasingly, as all thoughtful workers
must do, the darkness of the heathen mind and how little
after all was accomplished. Schwartz was no pessimist;
indeed, a careful study of his character gives the refreshing
idea of a man of vivacity and hopefulness, strong of faith
in God and ultimate victory, comforting himself with
the promise of Holy Scripture whenever the difficulties
were more than usually severe. With it all, there is the
revelation of the sense of self-abasement, the condemnation
of the slightest risings of pride and satisfaction which we
find in the lowliness of spirit of Thomas à Kempis and
other mystics. The mind of the man, too, is manifested
so clearly in his letters, which are like little windows
enabling us to look into this brave heart. He is writing
under date 17th October, 1755, to his old friend and guide,
Professor Francke at Halle, and breaks forth into a strain
of praise and thanksgiving: “Blessed be the God and
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the God of all true
consolation, salvation, and life, who mercifully and
gloriously helpeth us in all trouble! He is a God that
delighteth in our life, a God that humbleth that he may
exalt us, that maketh us to feel our wretchedness that he
may thoroughly save us from it. My soul doth magnify
the Lord!</p>

<p>“The distress of the Christian congregation and the
insensibility of the heathen to the word of God often
greviously afflict my soul, which is not yet experienced
in the ways of truth. However, I strive, as well as I am
enabled by the Spirit of Jesus Christ, to cast this burden
upon Him that is mighty to help and delights to bow
down to us in mercy that we may not remain and sink<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
in trouble. The words of Christ from Isaiah xlix. 4
often occur to my mind: ‘Then I said, I have laboured
in vain, I have spent my strength for naught and in vain,
yet surely my judgment is with the Lord and my work
with my God!’ But, indeed, the following verse ought to
allay all my grief and to bind the sorrowful heart to
the word of the divine promise. The unwearied patience
and mercy of God is working upon my own soul also
greatly comforting me, when He saith unto me, ‘Tell it
once more—go announce it to both Christians and
heathens, for thou also wert sometimes foolish, disobedient,
deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures,
and yet in that most corrupt condition, deserving wrath
and death, a merciful God hath wrought in thee for
Christ’s sake and waited for thy conversion, not a few
but many years. Now learn thou also to wait patiently
in hope.’ Now my heart, mind, thoughts, desires, designs,
and all my will be offered up to the will of my heavenly
Father. Not my will but Thine be done. Yea, let Thy
Kingdom come in India also to myself and others!</p>

<p>“As to outward circumstances, a gracious God hath
paternally preserved me and amidst bodily weakness
mightily supported me. Let my God only give me that
which Paul was enabled cheerfully to say, 2 Cor. v.
1: ‘We know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle
were dissolved we have a building not made with hands,
eternal in the heavens!’”</p>

<p>In the following year the missionaries gathered
together and commemorated with gratitude the jubilee
of the work, for it was on the 9th July, 1706, that
Ziegenbalg and Plütschau landed, as the first Protestant
missionaries at Tranquebar. They recalled the lowliness
of those two faithful pioneers, how they were rebuffed
and insulted by the European and civil authorities,
chilled by the attitude of the clergy and made to feel
unwelcome by their own countrymen in the presence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
of the heathen. But in those intervening years what had
God wrought! They sang their song of praise and
gladness, though at that very moment the native
Christians were passing through much persecution. For
it was the misfortune of the mission that, wherever
French interest and power were in the ascendancy, the
Romish priests and Jesuits brought trouble upon the
converts of the Protestant mission, and this often showed
itself by the malignity of the native rulers, who became
too easily the allies of the enemies of English rule. In
this respect the fortunes of the mission appeared to be
the shuttlecock of the contending parties in the game of
war. Besides all this the representatives of the great
religions of India, especially the jealous Brahmins and
the vindictive Mohammedans, were always standing ready
to strike a blow at the new religion of Jesus Christ, which
they foresaw would threaten the existence of their own.</p>

<p>In some cases, especially where no outside influences
had perverted their judgment, Schwartz found these
Rajahs and native chiefs were quite open to receive the
truth. A leading Hindu, the minister of state of the
Rajah of Tanjore, was ready and willing to acknowledge
that there is but one true God and that the images and
idols they ignorantly worship were only worthy of being
thrown into the sea. But while this was a step in advance
the opinion of this man does not seem to have carried him
very much farther, and his master, the Rajah, was also so
superstitious that he was prepared to make a sacrifice of
five hundred human beings in order to obtain some
imaginary hidden treasure which the evil spirits would not
relinquish except on that awful condition.</p>

<p>As Schwartz had acquired a fluent knowledge of
Portuguese he found many opportunities of speaking to
that large class of people who spoke the language, and
where there were signs of a real concern he could lead
them on by careful instruction in spiritual progress. As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
he looked wistfully into the faces of these young people,
the children of the Portuguese who many years before
founded the colony and inter-married with native women,
his soul yearned to bring them to a fuller knowledge of
Jesus Christ, for it must be to them the heathen would
look for evidence that Christianity was the gracious power
it professed to be. It was a work of patience and he did
not undertake it lightly or with any self-confidence. Here
is an expression of his mind at this time in a letter written
home to Europe:</p>

<p>“This is certain and I have it daily, that neither is
he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth, but
God that giveth the increase. He who, although
despairing of himself and his own strength, goes out in
all humility with prayer and supplication, seeks that
which was lost and then waits for the former and the latter
rain from the Lord, he receiveth blessing of God and is
preserved from much disquietude. And although the
blessing is not instantly visible, yet God awakeneth the
heart and enableth us to say, ‘At Thy word I will let
down the net. And when they had this done they
enclosed a great multitude of fishes.’ This text I
remember frequently, especially as it is that on which I
preached my first sermon at the University, and by means
of which God has produced in me purity of spirit and at
the same time a filial reliance on His word. May He
teach it me more and more and inculcate it by His Spirit.”</p>

<p>The visit of Schwartz and Kohlhoff to Negapatam
enabled them to give the European community there some
excellent advice as to their duty as representing a
Christian nation in their behaviour before the people.
This had such a good result that the Governor promised
to build a church for the use of the native Christians.
Schwartz certainly was an example of the truths he
taught, for wherever he went the greatest respect was
shown to him. The natives were eager to wait on him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
and sufficiently rewarded by his courteous acknowledgment.
A high caste Brahmin who had been listening to
one of his addresses said to Schwartz, in bidding him
farewell, “You are a universal priest”—a significant
compliment.</p>

<p>While Schwartz and his fellow missionaries were
quietly conducting their work at Tranquebar their
brethren in the Madras mission were passing through
trying experiences. The French were determined at all
costs to gain the paramount position as rulers of India,
and on the night of 28th April, 1758, they landed troops
near Fort St. David and ravaged the country in a lawless
and cruel way, which would not be likely to increase any
respect for Christianity in the minds of the natives. It
was a reign of terror, and large numbers of Roman
Catholic natives sought refuge in the walls of their own
church close to the Governor’s house, but a false report
was circulated that these fugitives were Protestant
missionaries with their converts and on that assumption
they were massacred in the sacred building, which was
afterwards entirely demolished. On the approach of
these soldiers, excited by their success, to Cuddalore, the
frightened inhabitants brought their treasures into the
mission house, and when the capitulation was arranged, the
French General, Count Lally, assured the missionaries that
they had nothing to fear, and it is a curious fact that a
German officer who had heard Mr. Kohlhoff preach at
Seringapatam was with the troops and gave orders to his
men to take care of the mission premises, while another
regiment under the French flag was almost entirely Irish
and were on their part most friendly. This providential
incident saved the mission, and the brethren were not slow
in showing their gratitude by giving refreshment to the
officers and soldiers and making them welcome to their
doors. Afterwards the French General visited the
mission and had long conversations with the missionaries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
in English, making many inquiries about their doctrines,
and how they made their converts. He gave them a free
passport to leave, which they did in two country boats,
collecting their little flock and bidding them farewell. It
was absolutely necessary for them to take this step,
because under present circumstances they would be
compelled to take an oath of allegiance to the French
Government. In due time they arrived at Tranquebar
and were welcomed by Schwartz and the brethren of the
mission. Through the instrumentality of Hüttemann, the
colleague of Schwartz who had come out with him, a
Pandaram of the highest caste was converted to
Christianity. On the 21st November, 1760, great interest
was awakened at Tranquebar by the funeral of an aged
Christian woman, one of the first five converts admitted
by baptism in the days of Ziegenbalg and Plütschau in
1707. Her life had been blameless and her testimony as
a former Mohammedan was always very profitable to her
friends.</p>

<p>Trouble now broke out afresh in Madras, for the French
were again investing the town, and the missionaries at
Vepery gathered together in prayer for the safety and
success of the British arms. During an assault on the
town the native horsemen who were assisting the French
troops swept down on to the mission buildings and robbed
the Christian men, women, and children who were in the
church for security. It is surprising that there was no
bloodshed, but, as one of the missionaries said, “Our
gracious God, however, without whose permission not a
hair falls from our heads, mercifully preserved his
servants, so that their persons were not touched and, with
the exception of being plundered, no one sustained the
slightest injury.” After getting some protection from
the French officers, Mr. Fabricius went back to his
dismantled station at Vepery, where everything was in
confusion and only a few manuscripts and books were left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
by the fierce Mohammedan troops. For some time it
seemed as if the English in the fort would not be able
to hold out, but at the critical moment their fleet
appeared before Madras and not only was the siege
abandoned but in several subsequent battles the French
power was, as regards India, broken for ever.</p>

<p>The visit of Schwartz to the island of Ceylon was in
response to an appeal by the Dutch missionary there, and
on his arrival he received a very respectful and kind
welcome from the brethren and also the Dutch
commandant. The missionaries were converted Tamils,
and it was a great delight to them to receive the
instructions and advice of Schwartz in their own language.
With unwearied zeal he travelled from place to place,
visiting the hospitals, preaching in the churches, and, at
the Governor’s request, administering Holy Communion.
But here his health broke down; what was the nature of
his sickness does not appear, but for a whole month he
was laid aside and the only record we have is the gratitude
of his heart when he was sufficiently recovered to begin
work again. At the end of his visit, on his way to India,
the ship lost sight of land and the Mohammedan sailors
implored him to tell them about Jesus Christ, and when
he did so they listened with respect. Schwartz was one of
those men of whom it may be said they are never off duty,
not only in his ministrations as a preacher, but continually
from quite unexpected quarters and at frequent times an
opportunity came or someone would open a conversation
with him, asking his help and advice. While he was at
Jaffna, for instance, a well educated and serious native,
who viewed religion as other matters from a scientific
standpoint, wanted him to relieve his mind of many doubts
on the subject of revelation. A long conversation
followed in which Schwartz tried to lead him from his
doubts one by one to a position of faith and liberty. The
closing advice exhibits the far-seeing judgment of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
missionary and is just as applicable to the case to-day as
then.</p>

<p>“It is very right to endeavour,” said Schwartz, “by
sound reasoning and argument to become convinced of the
truth of divine revelation, but this is not sufficient. The
chief cause of your unbelief is your own perverse will and
inclination. You wish that the word of God may prove
untrue for no other reason than this, that you may be
allowed to live undisturbed in sin, but I declare to you
that your understanding is convinced of the truth—your
heart and will must be changed. Turn therefore with full
purpose of heart to the living God and endeavour to obtain
grace and pardon through the blood of his atonement; and
watch and pray and you will find help. You must enter
upon this most important business with great zeal and
with a holy importunity.” It is stated that this advice
was evidently put to some good test, for the listener went
home greatly impressed, sent for one of his neighbours
who was an enemy and freely forgave him, making
reconciliation where there had been enmity and strife.</p>

<p>One of his public services while in Ceylon was at
Point Pedro at a spot which had become historic, for
under an ancient tree there the famous Dutch evangelist
Baldeus had first preached the Gospel to the natives in the
seventeenth century. Schwartz was deeply impressed as
he stood under the boughs of that old tree and proclaimed
the same saving truths to the people.</p>

<p>His letters are so full of interest and so self-revealing
that from one written to his friend, Dr. Francke, dated
16th October, 1760, an extract must be given, giving his
impressions of Ceylon.</p>

<p>“May I never forget the good I have received at the
hands of God; and may the remembrance of His great and
unmerited kindness strengthen me to do His will, and to
walk in the way of His commandments! I know indeed
from experience that after God has comforted the heart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
with the assurance of His grace and pardoning love, there
will be also found readiness and strength faithfully to
discharge our general and relative duties. May a merciful
God glorify Christ in my soul, as my adorable Mediator
and Redeemer, that I may taste and see how gracious He
is. I was much troubled and even somewhat impeded in
the discharge of my duty by a dry cough in January and
February last, which always greatly increased whenever
I attempted to remain for any length of time in the
open air, during the presence of northerly winds, on which
account an opportunity of taking a voyage to Ceylon was
particularly welcome to me. When I reflect how God
has condescended to humble and purify me by means of
an illness with which I was visited at Colombo, I am
constrained to praise Him in silence! ‘All the paths of
the Lord are mercy and truth,’ even when it would seem
as if He had visited us no longer and contrary to the
assurance which His word contains. I have reason to
think that the seed of the word sown at Colombo has
been productive, in some instances, of real and lasting
good. The Commanding Officer at Galle, a member of the
Reformed Church, appeared much affected and said to the
Lutherans, ‘I suppose you would be glad to receive a
similar visit once a year.’ And on my taking leave he
thanked me most feelingly for the edification he had
received and begged me to come again. The word of God
being so scarce in this island I assure you that the divine
service was conducted in a very solemn and edifying
manner. Indeed my inmost soul was moved by it.”</p>

<p class="ph3">A GLIMPSE OF THE MAN HIMSELF.</p>


<p>The time occupied by a missionary in mastering the
language of the people to whom he ministers is always well
spent. To some this task presents difficulties which make
the process arduous and prolonged, to others, happy in a
natural facility for learning another tongue, success is
more easily and quickly achieved. There is no doubt that
Schwartz had very remarkable linguistic capacities. To
him one language more or less did not seem to matter; we
have seen how he was fully at home with Tamil, and
he discovered that as Persian was the language of the
Mohammedans’ Court he ought to know it, and that
Hindustani would also be of service in speaking in the
presence of the Nabobs and high Indian officials, so he
must learn that too. So on his way he had a word for
everybody, the door of opportunity was the tongue of the
people, and each in his own language heard the word of
God. Whatever the station or caste, it was just the same,
their questions were respectfully answered, and they felt
that in this missionary a friend was speaking to them and
also one who knew more than they.</p>

<p>Schwartz and his friend walking by the sea-shore sit
down to talk with a group of fishermen. One of them
answers with the bitterness of conscious poverty, “You
are not in want and are therefore not prevented from
serving God,” but Schwartz points to the mighty deep with
its inexhaustible treasures and tells of the mercy of God.
A passing Brahmin asks why they have come hither.
“From Tranquebar,” answers Schwartz, “for the purpose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
of addressing to you the tidings of salvation.” For a few
moments the message was given, how the Lord of Heaven
called upon them to enjoy peace and happiness in another
world. “What would you have us to do?” The answer
came simple and clear: “We earnestly exhort you to
repentance towards God and faith in Jesus Christ.” “We
do worship God,” they replied, “and He being omnipresent
we may as well worship Him under the form of a stone.”
Schwartz then pointed out that there was no likeness of
the living God, either in heaven above or in this earth
beneath, and that therefore it was dishonouring Him to
worship Him in the form of anything corruptible.</p>

<p>He overtakes a young Brahmin carrying the idol Ramen
on a bench of wood and as he walks with him for some
distance the opportunity is given of opening up the
Scriptures and pointing out that idolatry can never help
and only Christ can redeem us from our sin. Sometimes
inquirers come to him, drawn by curiosity as to what this
Christian religion really means.</p>

<p>One day as he sat under a shady tree reading an English
tract on the parable of the Prodigal Son an old Hindu,
who had often refused to listen to his Christian sermons,
now came with others and begged to know what he was
reading. Schwartz told him that it was a narrative of the
truly paternal conduct of God towards us and of our
refusal to render due obedience to His kind and gentle
government, thus abusing His mercies and bringing upon
ourselves distress and misery. Notwithstanding this,
there was, he went on to say, a way opened by which we
might return to our justly offended Maker and become
partakers of His grace and benediction. The old man
being pleased with this parable, he proceeded to relate to
him that of the Sower, telling him why the seed did not
everywhere bring forth good fruit. He comprehended this
also perfectly and asked whether God is not omnipresent.
“Yes,” replied the missionary, “He sees everything that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
passes on earth whether it is good or evil but His omnipresence
is formidable to the wicked.” The Hindu then
said, “In my heart inwardly I worship God.” “If that
is the case,” answered Schwartz, “your outward conduct
must prove the reverence you profess to entertain in your
heart towards the Almighty. What would you think of a
man who reproached and even struck you, while he contended
that he had cordial love for you in his heart?”
The Hindu confessed that he could not value such love.
“Neither,” Schwartz concluded, “can God accept the
homage which you profess to feel inwardly for Him, while
in your words and conduct you deny and dishonour Him.”</p>

<p>It is very curious to observe how these Hindus and
Brahmins constantly took up the ground that they were
already worshipping God and did not need to change their
faith to please Him. When Schwartz was visiting Caroor,
twelve miles from Trichinopoly, he made a special effort to
reach these high caste men with the Gospel. He says of
them:—</p>

<p>“They listened with great attention to all that I told
them of the supreme excellence of the true God and of the
redemption of mankind from their fallen state by His Son
Jesus Christ. The next day I assembled a number of
natives under a tree and explained to them the Christian
doctrine. They felt how vain and irrational it was to
worship their numerous deities and fully approved of the
doctrine of one God, Creator of Heaven and Earth. I also
visited a Brahmin, who was considered the richest
inhabitant of the place; he allowed me without interruption
to expose the folly of idolatry and then said, ‘I also
worship God.’ We were interrupted by the arrival of a
Hindu who fell on his face before him. The Brahmin
took some ashes, which he spread over the poor man. I
told him how wrong he acted in accepting honours which
were due to God alone. Enraged at this reproach he
exclaimed, ‘Prove that there is only one God.’ This I did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
by directing his attention to the great works of Creation.
He dismissed me by saying, ‘In the same way that we bow
before the body of a man and yet mean to pay respect to
his soul, we bow before images and intend to worship God,’
a plausible excuse which has been argued in favour of
idolatry in all ages, but which is at once derogatory to the
majesty of the Supreme Being and destructive of all true
and acceptable worship.”</p>

<p>In a letter written about this time Schwartz opens his
heart to his friend at Halle on his own spiritual experience,
and from this we can gather how simple was his faith in
God.</p>

<p>“With respect to my present circumstances I feel constrained
to bless God for the manifold mercies showered
down in the past year upon me, the least of His servants,
through Christ’s atonement and intercessions. He has
supported me day by day in the most gracious manner, He
has instructed and reproved me by His Spirit, He has never
left me without consolation—there my soul does magnify
the Lord and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.
Indeed, I have the greatest cause for gratitude, for the Lord
has regarded the low estate of His servant, my joy is not
extravagant but calm and abiding, and my great aim is to
know that I am the Lord’s through Christ, that I have
found grace in His sight, that His peace rests upon me,
that I can confidently approach Him in prayer and have
a certain hope of Eternal life; so that even days of sickness
cannot deprive me of these consolations.</p>

<p>“Many of the Roman Catholics in this place acknowledge
the superior advantages which the pure Gospel has
over the confused doctrines and traditions of men; which
instead of relieving, only oppress the conscience. When I
visit them in their houses they listen to me gladly, and I
affectionately invite them to convince themselves of the
full, perfect and sufficient sacrifice, oblation and satisfaction
made by Christ for the sins of the whole world as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
foundation of their faith; and that, believing this, they may
enjoy peace of conscience and become partakers of the
precious blessings obtained for them by His sufferings and
death upon the Cross. I point out to them what Jesus
Christ Himself has taught respecting the way which leadeth
unto life and how much the Romish Church has deviated
from the pure doctrine of the Gospel. Father let Thy
kingdom come! O send forth faithful labourers into Thy
harvest!”</p>

<p>Sooner or later, in a country so disturbed by war and
strife, Schwartz was sure to get his baptism of fire, and
we find him praised as of great service in the siege of
Madura. Within the walls of this city Mahomed Issoof,
who at one time held a high appointment as commander of
the English Sepoys and had been active in reducing the
refractory tribes to order, was now defending the place
against his old employers. During one of the unsuccessful
assaults on the place Major Preston, a friend of
Schwartz, was killed and his dead body with all honours
was restored to the British camp.</p>

<p>Eventually Mahomed Issoof was betrayed by one of his
own people and afterwards treated with great severity. It
is not clear in what manner Schwartz distinguished himself
in this conflict—doubtless he would succour the sick and
care for the dying soldiers—but it is possible that his great
personal influence was for the first time used with the
natives on behalf of the British cause. When it was all
over a large sum was presented to him and he generously
devoted the whole of it to the use of the mission and for
the support of the orphans of English soldiers who had
fallen in the fight. This was the first time in which we
find Schwartz using his influence as a peaceful helper in
time of conflict; later we shall see with what success he
played the part of diplomatist at a crisis in the affairs of
India.</p>

<p>He had made many friends already among the English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
people; one of these was Mr. William Chambers, an important
official to the East India Company and a man of
great character and ability. He was a master of Oriental
languages and took a deep interest in missionary work as
a corresponding member of the Society for Promoting
Christian Knowledge. So close was his intimacy with
Schwartz that he had intended to write an account of his
life and labours, but this was cut short by his death and so
only a fragment of rough notes is left. From this, however,
we gain some interesting particulars of the mission,
and, particularly, the only glimpse of the striking personality,
as Mr. Chambers knew him, of Schwartz at this
time. He explains in this fragment of biography that he
first made his acquaintance with Schwartz when on a visit
to Trichinopoly from Madras in order that he might
perfect his knowledge of Tamil and Persian, and during a
prolonged stay, in a season of ill health, he came in very
intimate touch with the missionary who was so well
qualified to help him with those languages. Besides this
reason, however, he had a desire by personal inquiry to
estimate the value of the work in which Schwartz was
engaged.</p>

<p>“I had often heard mentioned,” he writes, “of Mr.
Schwartz before I went thither, as a man of great zeal and
piety, and of considerable attainments in the language of
the country, but as these accounts were in general given
me by those who viewed the excellence of a religious
character through the medium of popular prejudice, my
ideas of him were very imperfect, and as I myself had then
scarcely any better rule of judgment, a preconceived
notion of great strictness and austerity had mixed itself
with everything I had heard in his praise. The first sight
of him, however, made a complete revolution in my mind
as to this point. His garb, indeed, which was pretty well
worn, seemed foreign and old-fashioned, but in every other
respect his appearance was the reverse of all that could be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
called forbidding or morose. Picture to yourself a stout
well made man, somewhat about the middle age, erect in
his carriage and address, with a complexion rather dark,
though healthy, black curled hair and a manly engaging
countenance, expressive of unaffected candour, ingenuousness
and benevolence, and you will have an idea of what
Mr. Schwartz appeared to be at first sight. During the
intimacy which I had afterwards the happiness to contract
with him I learnt his past history.”</p>

<p>Mr. Chambers, after giving an account of the early days
of the missionary, and his work as tutor in the University
at Halle, reveals to us from the testimony of an observer
how thoroughly Schwartz worked in order to qualify himself
to the utmost for his important labours. There was
nothing superficial about this man, either as regards his
personal character as a Christian or in his work amongst
the natives; he never spared himself in taking pains to do
his best for them and he was equally honest in testing
their profession of Christianity and grounding them in the
faith. Mr. Chambers tells us that the people among whom
he had come to labour were a superior people with an
ancient stock and through generations back had pursued
learning and the arts and crafts with considerable success.
They were worthy of the best efforts for their conversion to
Christianity and these were put forth without stint.</p>

<p>“Mr. Schwartz, deeming it necessary, in order to converse
with advantage with these people, to be well
acquainted with their system of theology, whatever it was,
spent <i>five years</i>, after he had attained some proficiency in
their language, in reading their many mythological books
only. Hard and irksome as this task must have been to a
devout mind, he has reaped this benefit from it, that he
can at any time command the attention of the Malabars
by allusions to their favourite books and histories, which
he never fails to make subservient to the truth. He also
learnt at Tranquebar the Portuguese tongue, particularly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
that dialect of it which is used by the Portuguese who are
natives of India.</p>

<p>“The missionaries have found great numbers of these,
in every place at which they have settled, ready to embrace
the Protestant faith, or who, having already embraced it,
or been brought up in it as servants of Protestant masters,
were in need of instruction and of pastors. Willing, therefore,
to seek souls whenever they were to be found, they
have all voluntarily added the study of Portuguese to that
of Malabar and preach and instruct in that language also.</p>

<p>“Mr. Schwartz, however, while engaged in these
pursuits at Tranquebar, found his province there somewhat
confined and therefore sought and obtained permission to go
and establish an English mission at Trichinopoly where the
Gospel had not hitherto been preached, at least not for a
continuance. He was there happy in a correspondence
and frequent intercourse with another young missionary
named Dame, who was settled at Tanjore and was as
fervent and zealous as himself. The same spirit and the
same pursuit soon threw them into the strictest bond of
Christian friendship—the sublimest of all earthly affections.
Their prayers, their labours and their souls, were
united in the same glorious and never dying cause, for
which they had both resigned all temporal prospects. But
Mr. Schwartz did not long enjoy this source of comfort,
for being called over suddenly to see his friend, he hastened
to Tanjore and found him dead.</p>

<p>“At Trichinopoly he had much to do with very narrow
means. His whole income was ten pagodas a month or
about £48 per annum, and he had no other fund for
making a new establishment. I must here, however,
observe that though, computing at the usual rule of
exchange, one hundred and twenty pagodas must be allowed
to be equivalent to £48, yet if we estimate it according to
the effective value of money in India and in England it
will not be equal to half that sum. I mean that a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
European may live much better on £24 per annum than
he could in India for one hundred and twenty pagodas.
Let us see then how he managed with this income. He
obtained of the commanding officer, who perhaps was
ordered to furnish him with quarters, a room in an old
Gentoo [<i>i.e.</i> Hindu] building, which was just large
enough to hold his bed and himself and in which few men
could stand upright. With this apartment he was contented.
A dish of rice and vegetables dressed after the
manner of the natives was what he could always sit
cheerfully down to, and a piece of Chintz dyed black and
other materials of the same homely sort sufficed him for
an annual supply of clothing. Thus easily provided as to
temporalities his only care was to ‘do the work of the
evangelist.’ He preached to the natives incessantly, both
in the town and in the villages around, and was not long
without a congregation of converted Hindus, and among
them three or four who were capable of instructing others,
whom he therefore entertained as catechists and continued
to maintain out of his little income.</p>

<p>“But these were not his only labours at Trichinopoly.
He found there a large English garrison without a
chaplain, and to these also he sought to be of service by
every means in his power. The kindness of his heart and
the unaffected simplicity of his manners soon procured him
a civil reception among them and he improved this into
an opportunity of gaining a knowledge of the English
language, with which he was unacquainted at his first
arriving. After he had made, however, but a small proficiency
in English, he undertook to read the lessons to the
garrison on Sundays and at the same time read them
sermons from those of our English divines in whose
writings he discovered an evangelical spirit. But since
he has attained a more perfect acquaintance with our
language he has proceeded to preach extempore, which I
am told he still continues and is enabled to command the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
utmost attention in his auditory. It is indeed astonishing,
if we consider the manners of our troops to India, how he
has been able to persuade whole garrisons.</p>

<p>“At first he prevailed upon them to meet in a large
apartment in the old Gentoo building, but in time the
garrison resolved to subscribe to erect themselves a church,
and the money which would have been thought by
contractors a very inadequate sum has been so well
husbanded, and the materials and work, in consequence of
Mr. Schwartz’s knowledge of the country and its language,
were procured so exceedingly cheap that a very handsome,
lofty and roomy structure was raised out of it.”</p>

<p>At this point this fragment from the pen of Mr.
Chambers comes to an abrupt close, but enough has been
written to throw an interesting side light on the character
and work of Mr. Schwartz at this period. The building
referred to was duly completed as Christ’s Church, capable
of holding from fifteen hundred to two thousand persons,
with mission house and school adjoining, to complete
which he gladly devoted the whole of his salary of £100,
given to him by the government at Madras as chaplain to
the garrison. Its dedication was on 18th May, 1766, a
very impressive scene, when Schwartz, overflowing with
thankfulness, in company with his good friends Col. and
Mrs. Wood, acknowledged in prayer the goodness of God
in bringing all this to pass. Some of the expressions of
his earnest petition are still preserved. After the description
from the memory of Mr. Chambers it is not difficult
to imagine Schwartz standing reverently in this house of
God for the first time, a crowd of Europeans and natives,
especially the soldiers of the garrison, filling every seat.
His prayer was:—</p>

<p>“Most gracious God, we humbly rejoice in the assurance
of Thy holy word, that though Thou dwelledst not in
temples made with hands, yet Thou delightest in the
children of men, who as brethren meet together to confess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
their sins, to beg Thy Divine forgiveness, to implore Thy
goodness and to praise Thy Holy Name.</p>

<p>“Be merciful therefore unto us and hear our prayer
that we make before Thee in this place. As often as we
from henceforth shall assemble here let Thy Spirit awaken
our hearts to seek Thy face sincerely, without hypocrisy.
As often as we shall hear Thy word, let us do it with an
unfeigned intention to obey and keep it without exception.
As often as Thy Holy Sacraments, which are means of
entering into a covenant of love and obedience, are
administered to this house, O be pleased to make them
effectual to the salvation of our souls. And, finally, when
strangers who do not know Thy name hear of all the
glorious doctrines and methods of worshipping Thee
preached in this house, incline, O mercifully incline, their
hearts to renounce their abominable idolatry and to
worship Thee, O God, in the name of Christ! In this
manner make this a place where Thy name is glorified, Thy
kingdom sought for, and Thy will duly performed....</p>

<p>“Frustrate all the machinations of the devil against
this house, preserve it from all dangerous accidents, and
let it long be what we from henceforth humbly call it,
Christ’s Church.”</p>

<p>After this, with the consent of the Danish Mission and
the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, he
decided to make Trichinopoly his centre of work instead
of Tranquebar.</p>

<p class="ph3">WAYSIDE WORK.</p>


<p>The town of Trichinopoly, which for the next sixteen
years was to be his new sphere, was the second capital
of the Nabob of Arcot and his residence. It was here that
in 1767 he consented to become chaplain to the English
garrison on condition that at any time he might again
give himself wholly to the mission.</p>

<p>Once more the air was filled with battle-cries, and
Hyder Ali, the despot of Mysore, began to threaten the
great provinces of Southern India whose rulers had made
an alliance with the English for the common safety. A
large army prepared to march against the invader and in
one of the heathen temples at Trichinopoly, converted into
a hospital, Schwartz preached to the troops, standing for
a pulpit upon a heap of black polished stones. He then
went on a missionary journey to see the brethren at
Tranquebar. On the way he found plenty of opportunity
for giving his Gospel message to processions and wayside
pilgrims and especially at one place, Ammal-Savadi, where,
attached to a palace, was a row of houses nearly a mile long
built for the Brahmins. Here he gathered a large crowd
unto whom he preached the Word of Life, expounding the
parable of the Prodigal Son. One of the Brahmins, much
impressed, applied to himself the character of the
wandering son which caused Schwartz to exclaim: “O
that they would arise and go to their Father!” After ten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
days with his old friends at Tranquebar, he returned,
passing on his way a magnificent banyan tree, in the shade
of which the merchants were busy in their booths. To
them he spoke of the Supreme Being, the Fall, how Christ
came to redeem us, and that now there is a way of salvation
and a highway of holiness. They could not do otherwise
than agree with his earnest reasoning. “It is so written,”
they said, “but who can live thus? Who is able thus to
eradicate his desires? We have it also on the palm leaves
but it is impossible to keep it.” There appeared no active
opposition to his declaration of the truth. He records as
regards the way of salvation that he invariably and most
justly represented it “by true repentance, faith in the
Divine Saviour Jesus Christ and godliness springing from
a true faith. Not a single heathen made the least
disturbance, they listened in silence. Afterwards I
addressed them separately and exhorted them to receive
the saving doctrines of the Gospel.”</p>

<p>Nothing seemed to stir the heart of Schwartz more
than the abject idolatry of the people. He never
missed an opportunity of pointing out that their
superstition was no good to them, it could neither help nor
comfort them in their need. “We talked ourselves quite
weary,” he writes, “with various heathen. When the
catechist read to them our Lord’s warning against false
prophets and said something in explanation, a Brahmin
declared before all present: ‘It is the lust of the eyes and
of pleasures that prevents us from embracing the truth.’”</p>

<p>As a result of the continued fight with Hyder Ali,
Schwartz found on returning to Trichinopoly a number of
sick and wounded soldiers glad to welcome him back
again. He makes a note in his journal of several
interesting facts with regard to his ministrations among
these English soldiers in the hospital.</p>

<p>“Here I have often found,” he writes, “blessed traces
of awakening grace. A soldier said he had been such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
thirty-two years. I asked him how long he had served
Christ? He wept and replied, ‘Alas, I have not yet
entered His service.’” “An officer who had previously
discovered a great inclination to religion and entreated me
to instruct him catechetically, just as I would an ignorant
heathen, in which we had made a beginning, but were
interrupted by the war, was brought in mortally wounded.
He expressed a great desire for instruction. I
accordingly visited him daily and explained to him the
chief points in practical Christianity. After a few days
he appeared to be something better. He could occasionally
take the fresh air and his appetite returned. Under these
circumstances he gradually yielded to indifference as to
religion. He listened, indeed, but not with real
earnestness. At length I said to him, ‘I see you are
quite different. I fear you are deceiving yourself. Your
wound is as mortal now as it was fourteen days ago. When
you perceive that you are drawing near to your end you
will be terrified to think that you have been so foolish as
to allow worldly men to draw you off from the chief
concern.’ He replied, ‘It is true, they have flattered
me with the hope that I shall recover; but it is not so.
I know that my wound is mortal.’ After this he became
more earnest in prayer and meditation on the Word of
God. Before his death I visited him and exhorted him
to commit himself in faith into the hands of his Merciful
Saviour. Speaking was painful to him, yet he said he
hoped to obtain mercy, and thus he departed amid the
exhortations and prayers of those around him.”</p>

<p>He went frequently to the river where the Brahmins
used to assemble the people and read to them the history of
Ram. On his way he met one of the Court officials, called
the King’s Ahlikar, whose duty it was to go about the
place and among the crowds and then to make a report
to his Royal master of anything which he saw of an
extraordinary nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>“Tell the King,” said Schwartz, “that you saw me
and that I declared to great and small that they ought
to turn from vain idols to the living God, and that from
my heart I wish the King would set others in this respect
a good example.” “Good, good,” said he, “I will tell
him so.”</p>

<p>There was something in the personality of Schwartz
which greatly attracted the Brahmins, who were and still
are very loth to discuss the Christian religion. But with
this missionary at least they had no such reserve; indeed,
they often presented themselves as seekers after truth, and
quite frankly admitted the force of many arguments
advanced against their idolatry to be reasonable. It must
be considered that hitherto they had had little opportunity
of judging the claims of Christianity, for in the case of
the Europeans it was unhappily absent as any moral force,
and as presented by the Roman Catholics it contained an
element as idolatrous to their mind as their own. For
the first time they had come into touch with a man
who had a profound knowledge of their own position and
had a friendly and sincere sympathy in meeting their
difficulties and bringing light where they were in darkness.
He met them as a friend and yet never spared their
sinfulness, he never rebuffed them as beyond hope, he
cheered them with a loving message of peace from One Who
could save to the uttermost. These conversations are of
the deepest interest; the difficulties they disclose have not
changed and the answers which Schwartz gave are just
as wise and applicable as if spoken to-day. His journal
is rich in these incidents. A little hut of leaves of the
palmyra tree at Ureius near the foot had been put up by
him as a place of resort for quiet to which any inquirers
were always welcome. One day a group of Brahmins came
and he opened the conversation by asking them what was
their creed and what it all meant when they taught the
people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>“The eldest replied, ‘We teach that God is
omnipresent and is to be found in everything.’</p>

<p>“‘It is true,’ I said, ‘God is present everywhere and
to every one of his creatures but it does not follow from
this that you are to adore and worship every creature. If
you regard the heaven, earth, sun, and moon, as evidences
of the power, wisdom, and goodness of God and as
creatures that lead to the Creator you do well; but if you
invoke the creature, you ascribe to it the glory which is
due to God alone and fall into idolatry. Besides the
creature is not perfect but only a frail image of the
Almighty. Can an idol which is unable to see, speak,
or move, adequately set forth to you the majesty,
greatness, wisdom, and goodness of the living God?’</p>

<p>“They acknowledged that it could not. I next
demanded of a Brahmin whether he did not perceive that
the world was full of sin and that we should all be found
guilty and how he might obtain forgiveness? He
answered, ‘Through the mercy of God.’ ‘You say right,’
I resumed, ‘but you know that God is righteous and
punishes the wicked, how then can a just God be gracious
to such sinful creatures so as fully to pardon us and to
make us blessed?’ Upon this I explained to them the
doctrine of redemption through Jesus Christ and earnestly
exhorted them to embrace it.</p>

<p>“In one of the pagodas at Puttur there resides a
learned Pandaram who is generally friendly and does not
seem entirely to reject instruction. We both seated
ourselves on a bank of earth near a street. This brought
together a concourse of inhabitants. The Pandaram said:
‘My chief question to you again and again has been this:
How shall I arrive at a knowledge of God whom I cannot
see?’ I replied, ‘It has often been stated to you that
heaven and earth declare the glory of God. Reflect then
attentively on the creation and you will soon be convinced
that no other than an Almighty, All-wise and All-gracious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
Being produced it. This Creator we ought in
justice to reverence and adore, but you render this honour
to the creature and not to the Creator.’ ‘This,’ said he,
‘is all good but it does not satisfy me, this knowledge is
not of the kind I seek.’ ‘Well,’ I said, ‘do you desire
to have a clearer and more perfect knowledge? God has
in great goodness afforded it. He has taken compassion
on ignorant man and given freely to him His word and
true law, whenever He has revealed all the doctrines which
are necessary to the attainment of everlasting happiness.
He has made known to men, rebellious, corrupt, and lost,
the Saviour of the world, as the restorer of forfeited
blessedness and the way in which that salvation is to be
attained. In short, all that can make us holy and happy
is in this word of God made known to mankind. Read
and meditate upon it with prayer to God, so will it become
clear to you. Compare it also with your heathen
instruction and the superiority of the Divine word will
soon be discovered.’</p>

<p>“‘Still,’ said he, ‘this is not enough, for even if I
read this I cannot rightly conceive the idea of what God
is.’</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ I replied, ‘one thing is wanting to you,
namely, <i>experience</i>. Lay your heathenism aside; follow
the word of God in every point and pray to Him for light
and power. Then I may assure you that you will say
“Now I am like one who could not, from any description,
understand the nature of honey but now I have tasted
it and know what honey really is”.’”</p>

<p>Then as now too often the argument against
Christianity is the inconsistency of those who profess to
believe in it. This strikes a Mohammedan, for instance,
very much, and while it is, of course, no logical excuse, he
will make much of it to the detriment of the power of
the Gospel. Schwartz met with this on every hand;
Anglo-Indian Society was not at a very high moral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
water mark in the days of the Company, and it did not
escape the criticism of those dark and watchful native
eyes. There is an incident which illustrates the position
at Trichinopoly in the year 1768.</p>

<p>“The Nabob’s second son,” writes Schwartz in his
journal, “who is a genuine disciple of Mohammed, that
is, inclined to cruelty, watches narrowly the lives of
Europeans, and if he remarks anything wrong he
generally gives it a malicious construction as if the
Mohammedan doctrine rendered people better than the
Christian. This young man observing some Europeans,
entered into conversation with them. I was the
interpreter. ‘It seems remarkable,’ said he, ‘to me that
Christians are so inclined to card playing, dancing, and
similar amusements which are contrary to the true law.’
One of them answered, ‘We think it no sin, but an
innocent pastime.’ ‘Indeed,’ said he, ‘it is singular you
do not consider it sin to spend your time in such
amusements when even the heathen themselves declare it
to be sinful. It is certainly wrong to pursue such things,
though you are of opinion that there is nothing sinful in
them. You,’ he continued, addressing one of the party,
‘are a cashier, if you do not know the value of money
you inquire and inform yourself on the subject. Why
then do you not examine into <i>these</i> things? The
omitting such an examination is a sin also. Nay, if you
do not know whether it is right or wrong and yet continue
to play that is still a greater sin. I am sure Padre
Schwartz would tell you at once that it is sinful, if you
would but receive it.’ The cashier replied, ‘It is better
to play a little, than to absorb all one’s thoughts on
money.’ But the young Nabob answered him very
discreetly on this point, ‘that we are not to justify one
sin by another.’ So artful is he that he will accost and
converse with a European during divine service and
afterwards observe: ‘If the man had the least reverence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
for the worship of God he would not have allowed himself
to be interrupted.’ On the 15th of this month,”
continued Schwartz, “in the morning I had a conversation
with him. He first asked how God was to be served and
how we should pray to Him and censured us for not
washing our hands and taking off our shoes before prayer.
I answered that this was merely a bodily, outward act
which was of no value in the sight of God—that His
word requires pure hearts which abhor all and every sin
and approach Him in humility and faith—we could then
be assured that our prayer was acceptable to Him. One
of those present asked, ‘From what must the heart be
cleansed?’ I replied, ‘From self-love, from fleshly and
worldly lusts which constitute, according to the first commandment,
the real inward nature of idolatry.’ The
Nabob’s son said, ‘This inward cleansing is very good but
the outward is also necessary and God is pleased with it,
even though the inward cleansing be not perfect.’ I
replied, ‘Not so. You should rather say that God has
pleasure in inward purity, though the hands be not
washed immediately before prayer.’”</p>

<p>We have no means of knowing whether this young
quibbler was in the end awakened to a sense of his own
deficiencies. But we can judge by these conversations that
in Schwartz he had a patient as well as a faithful listener
who did not fail to show him the way of life and the
only source of grace and truth.</p>

<p>On one of the occasions when he could hold
conversations with the Nabob’s son over religious
matters, Schwartz impressed upon him the law of
brotherly love, even to enemies, which Christ enjoined
on His disciples. The answer he received was a
remarkable instance how in the poetical books of the
Hindus the same principle of meekness towards enemies
was laid down. “Of the behaviour of men in regard
to meekness,” said he, “four kinds were mentioned of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
which he gave the following explanation: <i>Schariat</i>,
<i>Terikat</i>, <i>Marifat</i>, <i>Hakikat</i>, are four ways which men
go.” “A young man,” he said, “once asked a priest what
he understood by these four ways? The priest desired
him to go into the market and give a blow (or box on
the ear) to each one he met. The young man did as
the priest desired. He struck the first man who met
him; now he was evil and returned like for like and
struck him again. The second whom the young man
met, was indeed wicked, and raised his hand to strike
him in return, but changed his mind, and went away
quietly. The third who was beaten was not wicked and
did not threaten to return like for like, in that he
thought the blow came from God. The fourth when
he was beaten was full of love and kissed the hand
that smote him. The first who when he was beaten
struck again, is an emblem of <i>Schariat</i>, or the way of
the world. The second felt wrath but overcame it and
is an emblem of <i>Terikat</i>. The third endured the blow
with patience and is an example of <i>Marifat</i>, or mature
knowledge. The fourth who kissed the hand that smote
him is an example of <i>Hakikat</i>, or inward union with God,
in that he regarded all the injustice that was done to
him as love on account of this union with God.”</p>

<p>Following the example of his Divine Master, Schwartz
turned from the arguments and equivocations of the wise
and prudent and looked with infinite compassion on the
sincere seekers after good, those who were poor and
simple, and were pitiful in their need and darkness.
Can anything be more touching or expressive of the
yearning of a loving heart than these words which
Schwartz addressed to such?</p>

<p>“At length I said, as I often do to them, ‘Do not
suppose that I reprove you out of scorn, no, you are my
brethren, we are by creation the children of one common
Father. It grieves us Christians that you have forsaken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
that almighty gracious Father and have turned to idols
who cannot profit you. You know, because you have
often heard, that a day of judgment is before us, when
we must render up an account. Should you persist in
remaining enemies to God and on that day hear with
dismay the sentence of condemnation I fear you will
accuse us Christians of not warning you with sufficient
earnestness. Suffer yourselves then to be persuaded,
since you see that He wants nothing of you but that
you turn with us to God and be happy!’ They all
declared that they were convinced of our sincere intentions
and that they would speak further with us.”</p>

<p>His hands were full but his work was the very joy
of his heart. One thought stirs him continually, the
need of these poor heathen and the sufficiency of Christ
for it all. He rejoices that in the midst of all his labours
he has such a measure of good health and he has signs
on every hand that he has not laboured in vain.
“Affliction, both from without and from within, has not
failed us but God has been our helper” is his testimony.
He finds that the natives are not ready to show the same
respect to his catechists as to Europeans, so here is
opportunity for encouraging the weak and he stands by
his native helpers like the strong good man he was. He
thanks God for Europeans, military and civil, who have
been led to make a stand for Christ, specially of one
young visitor. “He visited me several evenings and
acknowledged that he was stirred up to greater concern
for his salvation. I testified my joy but observed that
he was at present trusting to the sandy foundation of
his own righteousness, from which he could derive
neither rest nor power. He received all that I said in
good part and began to read his New Testament better;
that is with prayer. Shortly afterwards he was invited
to a gay party but declined it, which had a good effect
on others. He soon learned how the Gospel becomes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
saving and communicates to man more power unto
salvation than any considerations derived merely from
the law. He went boldly forth, and when many were
displeased that a young man should speak so freely, he
gladly bore the cross and his example has been a
blessing to others.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">IN FIRST TOUCH WITH TANJORE.</p>


<p>This ancient kingdom, adjoining that of the Nabob of
Arcot on the southern side, was at this time under the
rule of Rajah Tulsi, otherwise called Tuljajee. It was
described by Schwartz as “a well watered garden upon
which a large population managed to live, though
oppressed and robbed in the most unscrupulous manner.
If the ground yields one hundred bushels of rice the King
takes seventy and in time of war the whole is seized without
compunction. Therefore it was a proverb with the
people ‘Without stealing we cannot live.’” To this place
Schwartz was destined to bring the later years of his life,
with his ripe experience, wisdom, tact and unquenched
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>After some delays, caused by the incessant warfare in
the district, he started on his journey inland to Tanjore,
and arrived there on the 20th April, 1769. His first duty
was to visit the mission stations and schools and then he
sent word that he would like to interview the King or
Rajah. This was readily complied with and he tells us
how favourably impressed he was with one who, though
naturally much under the influence of the Brahmins, had
an open and intelligent mind toward religion. Tuljajee
was by no means an ordinary Indian despot; he was a good
Sanscrit scholar and had indeed written some poems in
that classic language; with a desire for information and
of a natural dignity of manner, this ruler, then in the
prime of life, was quite worthy of that special interest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
which Schwartz was destined to have in him. That he
was fond of ease and sought any means to indulge his
fancies might be expected. At five o’clock in the afternoon
of the 30th April, 1769, Schwartz was ushered into
his presence, finding him seated on a magnificent couch
suspended from pillars and surrounded by his high officers
of state. The missionary was invited to take the seat
provided before him and a good feeling was established
when in Persian the visitor spoke to the King, who said
immediately that he had received a good report of him.
Schwartz thanked him warmly for these kind expressions
and trusted that God might enrich him with every blessing.
As the interpreter had not fully delivered this statement,
one standing by said, “He wishes you a blessing.” The
King was pleased. “He is a priest,” he said, and was still
further impressed when Schwartz, to enable him to understand
more easily, began to speak in Tamil.</p>

<p>He had many inquiries to make of the missionary.
Evidently he had noticed or been told something of the
worship in the Roman Catholic churches, for he asked
how it was that some European Christians worshipped God
with images and others without them. The answer was
explicit, pointing out that the worship of images was
expressly forbidden by the word of God and that this
corrupt practice was because the Holy Scriptures had been
disregarded and taken away from the people. In answer
to questions as to the Christian religion, Schwartz with
the King’s permission very slowly and distinctly instructed
him in the word of God and warmly condemned the use of
idols, which, he said, the Europeans also worshipped before
Christianity came. The King laughed at this and said,
“He speaks plain!” Then followed the story of how man
has fallen and deliverance has come through the death of
Christ, finishing up his discourse with that matchless
parable of the Prodigal Son.</p>

<p>Sweetmeats were brought in, and before eating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
Schwartz asked permission to thank God for His goodness,
and then with fearless tact and simplicity he sang to the
King some verses of a Lutheran hymn beginning:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“My God, to thee this heart I bring,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>which had been translated into Tamil by Fabricius, and
departed. “I withdrew,” said he, “repeating my good
wishes for his happiness.”</p>

<p>The result of this favourable interview was the urgent
request of the King that he should remain in Tanjore, and
therefore, after consulting the brethren at Tranquebar,
Cuddalore and Madras, he returned and was soon again in
the presence of the King. “I explained to him,” he
writes, “the command of God relative to the consecration
of the Sabbath and His merciful intention in giving it,
namely, to make us holy and happy, by devoting it to the
concerns of our souls. He then inquired why we
Christians did not anoint ourselves as they did. I replied
that the heathen thought they were thereby purified from
sin, but we knew that sin could not be thus removed—that
God had provided a more effectual remedy, by sending a
mighty Saviour who had taken away our sins by the
sacrifice of Himself, and that we must seek forgiveness
through faith in this Redeemer.</p>

<p>“He then asked some questions respecting the King
of England and expressed a wish to visit our country. I
took occasion in reply to say something concerning the
religion which is there taught and how much it contributes
to the welfare both of princes and people, adding,
‘This is our wish, that you and your subjects may embrace
it, to your present and future happiness.’ The King
looked at me and smiled. His chief Brahmin often interposed
and told him what he had seen among the Papists
at Pondicherry, to which he replied that we were very
different from the Papists. He then desired me to speak
to the Brahmin in Persian, which I did and addressed a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
short admonition to him, but he professed to have forgotten
his Persian.”</p>

<p>From this time Schwartz with unflagging zeal lost no
opportunity of preaching the Gospel to the people in the
open air, until they were so affected that they cried, “O
that the King would embrace it! All would then forsake
heathenism!” He won their hearts. After speaking to
some of the King’s chief officers in the fort one of them
came forward and begged him to accept a present of some
money, but this he declined, explaining that he did not
wish to oppose any obstacle to their acceptance of
Christianity by giving occasion to any to suspect him of
interested motives. “He who tendered me the present
replied that he should never think that of me. I answered,
‘That may be but you cannot prevent others from thinking
thus; I seek the good of your souls and not gifts.’ I
accepted a nosegay and so we parted.”</p>

<p>But this free access to the King was short lived. The
Brahmins, like the Ephesians of old crying “Great is
Diana,” were discovering only too plainly that the
progress of Christianity would inevitably replace the old
religion and their influence with all its material
advantages would be gone for ever. So every attempt
on the part of the King to show favour to Schwartz was
defeated and concealed by those around him, and the chief
Brahmin at last persuaded him that any change would
disturb the whole of the country and that the people did
not want the missionary. This proved how correct was
his estimate before when he said the King was more of a
slave than a King, being so much under the domination of
the Brahmins. In his heart, there is no doubt Tuljajee
was most anxious to have Schwartz near to him, but was
overborne by his high officials. In his journal Schwartz
says of this crisis:</p>

<p>“Many even of the Brahmins themselves said that the
King would gladly have had me with him but he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
afraid of the people around him. The great about this
court saw with regret that he was desirous of detaining
me, being fearful lest their corrupt practices might be
exposed. At length I visited one of his principal officers
and after declaring to him the Gospel of Christ I begged
to make my humble salaam to the King and to ask what
was his purpose with regard to me, that I was come at his
gracious summons, ready to serve him from my heart in
the cause of God, but that as I had an engagement at
Trichinopoly it would be necessary that some one should
take charge of my duty there if I were to remain at
Tanjore. I requested therefore to know the King’s intentions.
The answer which I received the next day was
this, that I might return for the time to Trichinopoly but
that I was to remember that the King looked upon me as
his <i>padre</i>. Many of the common people were grieved that
the King should allow himself to be hindered by his
servants from detaining me near him. But God can and
at His own time will, cause this nation to adore and bear
His name. May He compassionate this poor people, now
lying in darkness and the shadow of death, for His name’s
sake!”</p>

<p>Subsequently a curious circumstance came to his ears.
A Brahmin who had been earnestly pressed to become a
Christian stated that the King of Tanjore had at one time
felt a strong desire to adopt the Christian faith and
gathered together all his chief officers and ministers to a
conference, when he stated what was his conviction in this
matter. This caused a general uproar; they remonstrated
with him, pointing out how faithful his fathers had been
to the worship of their gods and how they had prospered
thereby. They insisted upon his putting from his mind
this idea. But the Brahmin said it was a remarkable fact
that all these advisers who had withstood the King’s
resolve were now in prison or wandering about the country
as vagabonds and beggars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p>Back to Trichinopoly he soon began his work again
and once more came the people as inquirers, not scoffers,
to his side.</p>

<p>It is all so natural and their experiences and difficulties
were in their nature by no means confined to their day and
generation, and their sincerity was manifest even when
they did not carry it to the extent of believing in Christ.</p>

<p>Two gardeners stopped their work to ask Schwartz this
question: “We have not yet obeyed our own Shasters,
how should we now keep the true law? When we leave
you, we forget what we have heard.” He told them to
pray. “But how shall we pray?” This was his advice,
a bit of wisdom for all time. “Act like starving beggars.
Do not they know how to set forth their hunger and
distress? Set before God your ignorance, obduracy and
misery, and beseech Him to open your eyes and discern
Him and His true word. This you may do, even in the
midst of your labours. But come also and allow yourselves
to be instructed. Try this for ten days, it will
assuredly be better with you if you follow this advice.
<i>Consider that in a few days, perhaps, you may be happy or
miserable for ever</i>, give therefore all diligence and seek
your everlasting salvation.”</p>

<p>The Nabob’s son, accompanied by the Brahmin, asked
Schwartz to question him on the subject of religion.
“The great question is,” said Schwartz, “how shall we
be freed from sin, from its dominion as well as its punishment.”
The Brahmin excused himself on the ground
that he was not familiar with the Persian language but his
companion replied for him, “Hate and forsake anger,
sensuality, envy and so you will be clean.” “You
require life from the dead. Say to a dead man, walk! and
see if he would obey.” The young Nabob had his answer
ready: “What is not done deliberately will not be
imputed to us.” Then the missionary replied: “You
separate the holiness from the goodness of God. He will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
doubtless forgive but in such a way as that His holiness be
not thereby obscured—namely, through Jesus Christ.”
The young man walked away saying, “Certainly we must
confide in God so as to fear Him.”</p>

<p>In the midst of all these labours, these incessant conferences
and preaching, his own soul was being nourished
and kept by divine grace. Few men have left behind them
such undoubted evidence of their work, instances
abundantly testifying to the zeal and capacity of the
worker, his singular winsome attraction by which men
were drawn to him and the success which so often followed
his ministrations. He never spared himself; like his
Master he often had not so much as leisure even to eat.
But what were his own personal experiences during all this
activity? We know that with any real and serious
worker for God, the height of his success is the measure
of the depth of his own sense of unworthiness. The man
who like the Apostles stood without fear before the face
of a King, was in his own soul humble and adoring at the
feet of his Lord and Master.</p>

<p>Here is a picture of an ideal missionary’s day. It is
the steady, persistent, loved and reverent talk of one whose
very life is the service of his God. What fresh interest
there is in these simple records of his journal and how
little he thought that thousands would find, in the years
he would never see, inspiration and help by their perusal!</p>

<p>“October 22nd. I went out early to the river. Near
the river was a pagoda, where grew a beautiful and shady
tree. I seated myself beneath it and asked the heathens
who came near, what the pagoda was for and to whose
glory it was erected? Who the idol was, what he had
accomplished, and what his wife was called. When they
had quietly replied to all, I said to them: ‘All you have
now said relative to the idol, clearly shows that he was
a poor, dying and withal very vicious man, and therefore
you grievously sin against yourselves in appropriating the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
glory which pertains to the true God to a sinful creature.
After this the supremacy of God, as well as the deep
corruption of men, the unutterable love of God in sending
a Saviour, and the way to obtain a participation of this
wonderful grace of God, were pointed out. One of them
said: ‘It is our fate to be heathens and therefore a favourable
reason must come before we can get free from it.’
‘Can you call that fate,’ I said, ‘which you yourselves
acknowledge to be evil and yet persist therein, against
better knowledge and against conscience? Will God, to
whom you and I must render an account, accept that as
a suitable reason or excuse? Will you not bewail it for
ever that you waste the period of grace? It is the fear of
men which holds you all in bondage.’ To the last assertion
they assented. In the afternoon I had a conference
with many people adjoining the fort. They all listened
attentively. An animated young heathen said, ‘Show me
God so that I may behold Him and I will be your disciple.’
I said: ‘You talk like a sick person who desires health
without a physician. There is a way, true and revealed
by God Himself, by which man arrives at a vision of God.
That way is denominated true poverty of spirit, patience,
meekness, hungering and thirsting after righteousness,
etc.’ This was all explained and afterwards the young
man was questioned, whether this deterred him. But the
way seemed to him to be too difficult.</p>

<p>“As evening approached and I was about to depart,
a man of respectability sent to me out of the fort,
requesting me to wait a little as he was desirous of speaking
with me. He came rather late and then we discoursed
about the Christian doctrines, as well as heathenism and
its soul destroying nature. He heard in silence. The
Lord’s Prayer, which I paraphrastically explained to him,
pleased him.”</p>

<p>At this period, September, 1770, some of his letters are
full of self revelation. In those which he sent to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
intimate friend, Mr. Chambers, with whom he had so much
real and personal fellowship, he seems to lay bare his
heart and we see the inner workings of a noble, loving and
lowly spirit. Such confessions, aspirations and meditations
are too precious to pass into obscurity. He is still
speaking to us in our later age, and we seem to know and
love him better for such words.</p>

<p>“I thank you for your tender (I might almost say too
tender) regard for me, poor sinner. I wish, nay, pray
heartily that you may always appear clothed with the
righteousness of your Divine Redeemer. Just now we considered
to our mutual edification in our evening prayer,
that excellent chapter, Romans v.: ‘Being therefore
justified by faith we have peace with God through our
Lord Jesus Christ, rejoice in the hope of glory, rejoice even
in tribulation.’ What inestimable blessings are these!
And all purchased by Christ and given freely to all hungry
and thirsty souls! O that we might open our mouths wide
and be filled! As I read you once that passage in the
garden, so I could not help reflecting on it, nay I shall
remember you as often as I read it. May the Spirit of
God be poured out in our hearts, and may He display to us
the incomparable wonders of the grace of God towards
us!”</p>

<p>He had been reading in the Revelation about the
Epistle sent to the angel of Ephesus, whose first love had
been deserted and now while still cold and indifferent many
things were being performed more from custom than love.
The thought of a soul in that condition deeply touched
him. He writes:</p>

<p>“I cannot say how that tender and mournful complaint
moved me. It was as if Jesus stood before me, telling me
‘I have that against <i>thee</i>.’ My heart was quite melted
down. Yes, no doubt too many things, otherwise good in
themselves, are done without that noble spirit of love. O
that my heart might bleed for that unaccountable coldness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
with respect to the love I owe to my blessed Redeemer!
I repent of it sincerely, though not so as I wish, remembering
how great the fall is. But how cheering is the promise
which that beloved Redeemer gives to all those who overcome
that coldness and strive to be fervent in love. They
shall ‘eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the
paradise of God, they shall enjoy the sweet favour and
love of God, they shall see and taste how good the Lord is.’
May this inestimable promise keep up a fire of love in our
heart! May we condemn all coldness and mere formality
in religious exercises! I hope your heart is burning with
the love of Christ, as the heart of the disciple on the road
to Emmaus. Indeed, materials to kindle that fire within
us are not wanting, provided we take care and be vigilant.
Let us then mutually excite one another as long as we have
opportunity, and let not the multiplicity of business damp
that holy flame, which ought to be burning continually.
My heart wishes you may be always a shining light!”</p>

<p>Later on he is writing again, full of good wishes for
his friend in the New Year:—</p>

<p>“O may Jesus be glorified in your precious soul, so as
to be your wisdom and righteousness, sanctification and
redemption! We were reading and meditating this
evening on Colossians ii. wherein Jesus is set forth as our
all—the sun, the centre, and fountain of all our bliss.
Whatsoever we want we find in Him, and are as the Apostle
says ‘complete in him.’ In Him we are circumcised by
putting away the body of sin, which is the true spiritual
circumcision when we are buried, by being baptized in
His Name, in Him we are raised from the dead by believing
in Him and His divine resurrection, by Him we are
quickened with a true sense of the paternal favour of God,
having our sins pardoned. If then we have all in our
Divine Redeemer, how just and comfortable is the conclusion
that we are not to look out for any happiness in the
new moons, etc. Why should we run to the shadow having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
and possessing the body? Why should we complain of
want of comfort and strength, having Jesus? Let us stir
up one another to a faithful adhering to the fountain of all
our bliss. But let us receive Him entirely as our all—love,
serve and glorify Him as such by our whole life.”</p>

<p>His mind has been dwelling upon the exhortation of
St. Paul that we “be strong in the Lord.” He knows
what it is to meet with powers of darkness and enemies
which are for ever attacking him without and within.
But he takes heart and admonishes his friend to be
faithful.</p>

<p>“Let us stand, therefore, having our loins girt about
with truth. The truth of the Gospel, particularly concerning
the Author of our salvation, is like a girdle that
will keep close and, as it were, unite our strength. But as
the principal truth of the Gospel concerneth the righteousness
of Jesus Christ, let us above all take and put on that
perfect righteousness as a ‘breast plate’ which covers our
breast and screens our conscience, so that no accusation or
condemnation can reach and disturb it. And as the
Gospel contains and sets forth that glorious righteousness
of Christ let ‘our feet be shod with the preparation of
peace.’ When our enemies deride our relying on the
righteousness of Christ and ask us from whence we have it,
let us say ‘So it is written.’”</p>

<p>In a subsequent letter he has been referring to the
dismissal of some one, unworthy doubtless, from the work.
He believes that God will bring good even out of this evil.</p>

<p>“Whatever we do let us do it with humility and submit
the whole to God who can mend and rectify what is amiss.
When I read the Evangelists, particularly the speeches
of our Saviour to His disciples towards the latter end of
His ministry, I think they consist mostly of admonitions
to humility. And when we consider how long God has
borne with us, I think we should not soon lose patience
when we endeavour to mend others. Yesterday we treated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
in church of Ephesians vi. 1-6. To walk worthy of our
vocation or calling, how necessary! And in order to do
so, humility is placed in the front. Meekness follows as
a consequence and forbearance. O may the Spirit of
Christ lead and strengthen us at all times.”</p>

<p>After quoting from his Greek Testament those wonderful
verses in St. John’s Gospel, chapter xvii. 3, 11, 14,
18, 21, he urges again the blessing of unity, writing:
“Let us, therefore, according to that heavenly pattern and
divine admonition, strive to be one, one in doctrine, one in
adhering to Christ, one in loving Him, one in despising
and renouncing the world, one in loving one another, and
one in bearing the cross. As God has made us equal in
the share of the most glorious benefits of the Gospel, one
baptism, one hope, one glorious Redeemer, so He has
thereby designed us to be the same in brotherly love. And
as without joint prayer that brotherly love cannot be
kept in proper vigour, let us endeavour to keep up that
holy exercise.”</p>

<p>With Schwartz the practice of brotherly love was part
of his daily life, it seemed natural to him to show charity
and to make no difference in dealing with native or
European. It was his custom at the meetings of the
missionaries for worship and prayer to admit the natives
and in not a few instances it was seen that good results
followed this practice. It will be sufficient to mention one
case of which Schwartz makes a note in his journal:</p>

<p>“Here I had a few days ago an example which pleased
me very much though attended with trouble. A young
man of twenty-four years, of the Shraf caste, resolved to
visit us at an evening prayer—heard the word of God
explained, joined in prayer, meditated what to do—came
to a settled resolution to join the despised people of God.
Not poverty, not quarrel, but a desire of being happy
inspired him. He was engaged to marry a young woman,
the daughter of a rich man at Seringapatam. The day of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
their wedding was appointed. He told his mother that
he would fain marry the girl but not with idolatrous rites.
The mother said, ‘I wish I had killed you as soon as you
were born, etc.’ All this happened before his being
baptized. The relations got him cunningly and kept him
a close prisoner; but he found opportunity of making his
escape and came hither to Tanjore. His mother and others
made a great noise and came and begged I would not
admit him. I replied in the presence of the Brahmins
and a number of people that I never forced anybody and
that I could not reject him if he desired me to instruct
him. Further, I said, ‘Here he is; ask him whether he
likes to go with you or stay with us.’ The young man
said, ‘Mother and friends, if you can show me a better
way to heaven I will follow you—but I will not live any
longer in idolatry.’ I remained in my house; the young
man went to the chattiram; his relations followed him and
fairly carried him off to Vellam; but he again contrived
to make his escape. After that I instructed him daily and
baptized him. May Jesus triumph over all His enemies
shortly.”</p>

<p class="ph3">AS PEACEMAKER WITH HYDER ALI.</p>


<p>In the journal of Schwartz we have some very interesting
records of his work among the military, and he speaks
with gratitude and affection of the little group of pious
and devoted English soldiers who met from time to time
for prayer and worked so hard in the service of Christ.
It is refreshing to see in those early days, when beyond
the chaplains there was no one to look after the soul
of a soldier, that Christ had His witnesses in the ranks
who lived bravely and died well in the Faith. Of one
of these Schwartz writes: “There was a manliness in his
whole deportment. The Gospel of Christ was precious to
him and produced a settled peace and holy courage in
his heart. This year he became sick. His pious
companions visited him diligently. His mind was
perfectly composed and he longed for the Holy
Communion, which was administered to his edification.
Some hours before his death I visited him and found him
in a most happy frame. ‘My sins,’ said he, ‘are forgiven
me of God for Christ’s sake, my heart has rest and peace,
the enemy has no power over me. I look forward with
complacency to a blessed eternity. I would not exchange
with the King of England. O the poor world that it
could but reflect what a blessed thing Christianity is!’
Then turning to me he said, ‘And I thank you, my friend,
for having made Jesus Christ known to me!’ At last he
repeated several times that beautiful sentence, ‘Into Thy
hands I commit my spirit, Thou hast redeemed me, O
Lord God of truth.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<p>In his letter of 10th August, 1771, Schwartz refers
to the air being filled with rumours of war and that the
English troops are moving on to Tanjore. The King,
who had shown such friendliness to Schwartz, was in
difficulties, and General Smith with his soldiers was
investing the foot of Wallam or Vellam, the strongest
defence of Tanjore. A battle had already taken place
and the storming of the walls was imminent, when a treaty
of peace was suddenly signed and hostilities ceased. A
little later on Schwartz was again in Tanjore and the
King asked once more to see his old friend. He was
taken to a shady spot and the King came under a yellow
umbrella, looking much thinner and not so well as when
they met two years before. “Padre,” he said, “I wish
to speak with you privately” and led him away. But
the chief Brahmin, who no doubt was on the alert, would
not leave them alone and came in. On his entry the
King bowed low and stood before him with folded hands,
an evident sign of the absolute ascendancy which this
priest had gained over his mind and action. The Brahmin
took an elevated seat and required Schwartz to repeat
the sermon which he had delivered at the Palace the day
before. This was done very faithfully, to which the
Brahmin listened in silence, but the King afterwards
asked some questions about repentance and whether a
man might return to his sins again. Schwartz replied
that “true repentance consisted in a hatred of all sin,
which was inconsistent with such a return.” Afterwards
at a subsequent interview the poor ruler, the slave of his
courtiers and sadly addicted to intoxicating drugs and
the love of women, said to the missionary, after an earnest
personal appeal that he would give his heart to God,
“Alas! my padre, that is no easy matter!”</p>

<p>But in spite of the opposition and intrigue of his
Brahmin advisers, the distracted King of Tanjore was
compelled to seek the help of his old friend to save<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
him from political complications. And here it is well
to observe how unwilling Schwartz was to be drawn in
as a judge in the strife of politics and the hazard of
war. He felt so keenly that his proper place was the
sphere of the souls of men, that he was most anxious not
to allow anything to interfere with his liberty as a
preacher of the Gospel, with hands clean from the
suspicions of a bribe, and willing to be the friend for
Christ’s sake of both sides, if by any means he might
save some. Of course, as unofficially representing the
British Government and acting as chaplain to their
troops, he was in a sense committed to advance their
interests in every possible way. On the other hand he
felt that this strong confidence which he had inspired in the
hearts of the native rulers, especially King Tuljajee of
Tanjore, was a sacred advantage which he must use for
the highest purposes and ought to exercise if need be to
keep the peace and save conflict. The King had sent
for him again because he felt that his friendly understanding
with the English was not so cordial as it had
been. So he asked Schwartz to interview them on his
behalf. But the position was fraught with risks, and
he records his impressions. “Now this in itself would
not be sinful but it is a dangerous matter to engage in
such things with a people so prone to deceit and this I
distinctly avowed to them. The King said, ‘Padre, I
have confidence in you because you are indifferent to
money.’ But his officers did not wish me to be engaged
in this affair lest their own iniquity might be discovered.
And thus it passed off; for which God be praised, as I
had no occasion to declare fully my averseness to the
employment.”</p>

<p>Things went, however, from bad to worse; the Nabob
of the Carnatic pressed his claims, and the English
supported him against Tuljajee. Schwartz saw the
King’s impending doom and could not prevent it, and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
a sense he felt the punishment was a just judgment on
the corruption and superstitious blindness of his rule. It
was not for want of warning but in face of the clearest
light that this weak and miserable King had erred. “I
am afraid,” writes Schwartz, “Tanjore has filled up the
measure of its sins and is giving up. Certainly the poor
Rajah was blind and infatuated, otherwise he might have
prevented the present misery that comes upon him. In
January I was there the last time. I warned them and
told them that in the present course they must perish.
Manoziappa’s son said, ‘What can we do?’ I answered,
‘Turn to Him who can help you!’ He said, ‘It is not
the way of the world?’ ‘Well,’ I said, ‘the course of
the world will undo you.’”</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards the army moved to invade Tanjore
and the place was captured with hardly any resistance
or loss, the poor affrighted King and his family were
made prisoners, the Nabob took the kingdom and its
treasure, and Schwartz found himself and his work under
new masters and at a disadvantage. He appealed for
more considerate treatment but was refused, and he
reported the state of affairs to the Society for Promoting
Christian Knowledge, pointing out “that many of the
best families would not hesitate to become Christians,
could it be shown how they could maintain themselves.
But the difficulties are now greater than when Tanjore
and the Marawar country had their own princes and
governments, many thousands of the inhabitants having
quitted the country for want of food and employment.”
Happily, after the position had been discussed in England,
the Court of Directors of the East India Company
disapproved of what had taken place, and for the sake of
British interests the restoration of Tuljajee was carried
out in April, 1776, and once more Schwartz felt that
his influence was restored for the good of the work. But
the contention which this new policy caused in Madras<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
again made it impossible for any amicable arrangement
to be made, and the Council begged Schwartz to bring
the pressure of his personal influence to bear upon the
King, but this he refused to do as it would interfere with
his sacred functions. “This is the cause,” he writes,
“of my not having conversed with the King for six
months past. It is with great regret that I have to
inform you that he has lately given way to a luxurious
and dissipated life, so that little hope can now be
entertained respecting him.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, to help the work at Tanjore, Schwartz
made himself proficient in the Mahratta language and
wrote a dialogue in that tongue on the Christian faith
which was fruitful of good results. He resolved to stay
at Tanjore and found much cause for encouragement in
his converse with the Brahmins, many of whom admitted
that nothing but fear of consequences prevented them
from being Christians. The poor puppet of a King,
however, was rapidly going downhill, drink and
sensuality had done their work, and his authority was
counting for little in any quarter. A small church was
being built in the fort and Schwartz preached the opening
sermon after the General of the English troops had laid
the foundation stone. The Madras Government were
anxious to make Schwartz a handsome present of money
for his work among the soldiers and other services, but
he refused it, asking only for some bricks and lime to
help to build his church.</p>

<p>It was just at this time, in March, 1779, that he
received an urgent summons to see Sir Thomas Rumbold,
the Governor at Madras. On his arrival he was told that
he was desired to undertake a very important mission
to Hyder Ali at Seringapatam to discover his real
intentions and to assure him of the peaceable thoughts of
the English. “As the intention of the journey is good
and Christian, namely, to prevent the effusion of human<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
blood and to preserve this country in peace, this
commission militates not against but highly becomes your
sacred office and therefore we hope you will accept it.”
This was an honour and yet it meant great danger;
Schwartz made it a matter of much prayer and finally
agreed to go, feeling that in so doing he was fulfilling
the will of God. He had very carefully considered the
question from all its bearings, as was his wont, and
decided on three grounds, 1st, that its aim was to promote
the blessings of peace; 2nd, because he could thereby
preach the Gospel in many parts hitherto unvisited; and
3rd, the Company had shown him great kindness and he
wished to return this with some gratitude. But he
would accept no presents and not a single farthing would
he take beyond his travelling expenses. He stayed a
month at Caroor on his way, and with the assistance of
his only fellow-traveller, Sattianaden, he preached to
crowds of people and discussed privately the doctrines of
Christianity with many Brahmins. Afterwards he
climbed the steep and dangerous path from Guzzulhatty,
and being now in Mysore talked to the Brahmins in
Hindustani, one of them telling him that “Hyder is
quite unconcerned as to religion; he has none himself
and leaves everyone else to his choice.” In a short time
he reached Seringapatam and his impressions of the place
and an account of his reception by this despot are so
admirably told in his journal that an extract, therefore,
must be given <i>in extenso</i>:</p>

<p>“The palace of Hyder Ali, built by himself, is very
beautiful according to the style of Eastern architecture.
It is entirely of hewn stone with numerous pillars. At
the extremity of the pagoda stands the ancient palace of
the Kings of Mysore. The former possessor of the throne,
to whom Ali allows an annual income, still inhabits it.
He has his servants, but is treated as a prisoner of state;
Hyder himself sometimes visits him and stands in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
presence as a servant. Thus men of the world can
dissemble. The King’s sons are all dead and the general
opinion is that they were secretly dispatched.</p>

<p>“Opposite the palace is a large square, on two sides
of which are open buildings in which the military and
civil servants of Hyder have their appointed stations for
conducting public business. He can overlook them from
his balcony, and as they are required at appointed times
to be in the places assigned them, to receive the reports
of the country and army, whoever has business to
transact knows where to find them. Here reigns no pomp
but the utmost regularity and dispatch.... Though
Hyder sometimes rewards his servants, the main spring
of action here is terror. Everyone performs his part from
a motive of fear, well knowing the consequences of any
neglect of duty. Persons of the highest as well as of
the meanest condition are punished with the same
instrument. The tyrant keeps two hundred men with
whips in constant readiness; and no day passes without
many being chastised. The Governor of a whole district
is whipped in the same manner as the meanest groom.
Hyder treats them all alike. Even his two sons and his
son-in-law are liable to the same cruel usage. When
any one of his highest officers has been thus publicly
flogged he does not allow him to resign his employment
but compels him to retain it, that the marks of the whip
on his person may serve to deter him from repeating
the offence; for he seems to think that almost all persons
who seek to enrich themselves are devoid of all principles
of honour.</p>

<p>“Entering the palace one evening I observed in the
audience chamber a number of people sitting in an arch.
By their dress I perceived they were collectors of districts
and in their countenances the marks of anxious fear were
visible. I was informed by Hyder’s Persian secretary that
they were come to submit their accounts. They appeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
to me like criminals expecting death. Very few were able
to render them to Hyder’s satisfaction and in consequence
dreadful punishments were daily inflicted. I hardly know
whether to mention how one of these unhappy men was
treated. The poor criminal was tied to a post, two men
approached with whips and flogged him in the most cruel
manner, the pointed nails lacerating his flesh. The cries
of the wretched victim were most heart piercing.</p>

<p>“But notwithstanding this severity of punishment
there are numbers who eagerly seek these lucrative
employments and even out-bid each other. The Brahmins
are the worst in this traffic. When one of them has
obtained a district he fleeces the inhabitants without
remorse. At length when called upon by Hyder for his
arrears he pleads poverty and having undergone a
flagellation returns to renew his exactions. Can we be
surprised if the people under such a Government lose all
sense of shame?</p>

<p>“Hyder’s army is under the management of four
chief officers (called baschi). They may be considered
as paymasters but their office is not confined to paying
the troops, as they have to provide for the
recruiting service and to regulate other military matters,
being likewise judges for the decision of private quarrels.
With these people I often conversed. Some of them
speak Persian, others only Hindustani, and all are
Mohammedans. They once asked me what was the most
acceptable prayer and to whom it ought to be addressed?
I explained to them that as sinful creatures and therefore
deserving eternal death, we could only approach the
Almighty in the name of the Mediator, Jesus Christ, and
then expounded the Lord’s Prayer. They next inquired
whether the Lord Jesus in His Gospel had fixed the period
of His coming and of the day of judgment. In reply to
this I explained to them the doctrines of the Gospel, to
some in Tamil, to others in Hindustani. As the household<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
of Hyder consisted chiefly of Brahmins, I had very
frequent conversations with them. Some of them gave me
very modest answers, whilst others avoided the discussion
and gave me to understand that they did not consider
their temples to have been built in vain. ‘The building,’
I replied, ‘may be useful, but the idols you worship are
worthless.’</p>

<p>“Without the fort several hundred Europeans were
encamped, some of them were French, others German.
I also met with a few Malabar Christians, whom I
had instructed at Trichinopoly. To find them in that
country, far from all Christian ordinances, was painful,
but to renew the instruction which they had formerly
received was very comfortable. Captain Buden, the
commander of the German troops, lent me his tent, in
which I performed Divine Service every Sunday, without
asking permission, acting in this as one bound in
conscience to do his duty. We sang, preached and prayed,
no one presuming to hinder us. The whole I considered
as a kind providence of God.</p>

<p>“To Hyder’s palace high and low came, inquiring of
me the nature of the Christian doctrine, so that I could
speak as long as my strength allowed. Hyder’s younger
son (not Tippoo), seeing me in the Durbar or hall of
audience, saluted me in a friendly manner and invited me
to pay him a visit in his own apartments. I told him I
would come most cheerfully, provided his father would give
permission, since to do so, without his consent, might prove
injurious both to himself and to me. Of this he was
perfectly aware. Even the most intimate friends do not
venture to speak their mind freely. Hyder has everywhere
his spies, but I knew very well that on the subject of
religion I might discourse day and night without fear of
giving him the least offence.</p>

<p>“When I was admitted to an audience Hyder bade
me sit next to him on the floor, which was covered with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
the richest carpets, and I was not required to take off
my shoes. He listened to all I had to say, expressed
himself in a very frank and open manner, and told me
that notwithstanding the Europeans had violated their
public engagements, he was willing to live in peace with
them. A letter was then read to me which had been
prepared by his order. ‘In this letter,’ said he, ‘I have
stated the substance of our conversation but you will be
able to give further explanations personally.’ Hyder
seemed by this expression to consider my visit as the
preliminary to a treaty of peace, but the Nabob at Madras
defeated all these intentions. While sitting near Hyder
I was struck with the expeditious manner in which the
public business was dispatched. When he had ceased
conversing with me some letters were read to him and he
dictated an immediate answer. The secretaries hastened
away, wrote the letter, read it before him and he affixed
his seal to it. In this way many letters were written in
the course of the evening. Hyder himself can neither
read nor write, but he has an excellent memory. Few
have the courage to impose upon him. He orders one
to write a letter and then has it read to him, after which
he calls another and hears it read a second time, and if
the secretary has not strictly conveyed his meaning, or has
in the least deviated from his orders, his head pays for it.</p>

<p>“I frequently sat with him in a room adorned with
marble pillars, opening into the garden, which though
not large, as it could not be in the fort, was neatly laid
out with trees which were grafted and bore two kinds of
fruit, rows of cypresses, fountains, etc. Observing a
number of youths carrying earth in the garden, I
inquired respecting them and was told that Hyder had
established a battalion of boys, all of whom were orphans
and whom he had taken under his protection, boarding
and clothing them and furnishing them with wooden guns
for the purpose of their exercise. This care of poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
orphans really pleased me and I wish our Government
would in this particular imitate the example and improve
upon it, particularly as to religious instruction, so as it
becomes Britons and as God will certainly require it at
our hands, who hath armed us with power, that we
should use it chiefly for His service and glory and not
merely for our own. On the last evening, when I took
my leave of Hyder, he requested me to speak Persian
before him, as I had done with some of his attendants.
Of this language he understood a little, but he does not
speak it. I did so and explained the motives of my
journey to him. ‘You may perhaps wonder,’ said I,
‘what could have induced me, a priest, who has nothing
to do with political concerns, to come to you, and that
on an errand which does not properly belong to my
sacerdotal functions. But as I was plainly told that the
sole object of my journey was the preservation and
confirmation of peace, and having witnessed more than
once the misery and horrors attending on war, I thought
within my own mind how happy I should esteem myself
if I could be of service in cementing a durable friendship
between the two Governments, and thus securing the
blessings of peace to this devoted country and its
inhabitants. This I considered as a commission in no
wise inconsistent with my office as a missionary of religion
of peace.’ He said with great cordiality, ‘Very well,
very well! I am of the same opinion with you, and my
only wish is that the English would live in peace with
me. If they offer me the hand of peace and concord
I shall not withdraw mine provided ——.’”</p>

<p>What those provisions were was never known. The
interview was over, and apparently the tyrant must have
showed to Schwartz his better side, for there was nothing
in his actions to indicate any desire for peace or the good
of humanity. A despot who pitilessly slew his enemies
without mercy, whose officials high and low lived in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
reign of abject terror, who had depopulated entire districts
with the sword and whose ferocity had not even the
limitations of any religious consideration, was hardly the
man to appreciate any proposals for peace and goodwill.
On the other hand, it speaks well for the influence of
a pure and fearless personality like that of Schwartz that
he could have instantly inspired respect and attention.
When he left Hyder he found a handsome present in his
palaquin, which he would have returned forthwith but
the officials assured him it would imperil their lives for
him to act so contrary to the etiquette of Hyder’s court.</p>

<p>Although in his journal no further particulars are
given of this interview, amongst the papers of the late
Mr. Huddleston was found a note of what Schwartz had
told him respecting the attitude of Hyder.</p>

<p>“In his very first interview Hyder told him that he
was made an instrument to cover intentions and views
very different from the purity of his own mind, that the
English had adopted the designs of his enemy (the Nabob)
and that it was now too late to convince him that they had
altered their policy or that they entertained any views
really friendly towards him. He then requested Mr.
Schwartz not to renew the subject, but assured him that
for any other purpose he was welcome to stay in Seringapatam
and should receive every attention and might come
to his Durbar as often as he pleased, and thus remarkably
concluded ‘that he had also his free permission to try to
convert any of his people to his religion, if he thought he
could succeed, for he was sure he would say nothing
improper to them, or that would tend to injure his
authority.’”</p>

<p>Doubtless the character of the English, as represented
by the policy of the East India Company, fully justified
the suspicions of Hyder; indeed, in the letter which
Schwartz brought back, there was a haughty recital of
the misdeeds of the Company, military and civil, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
concluding with these terrible words, bespeaking the
vindictive spirit of the writer: “<i>I have not yet taken my
revenge and it is no matter.</i> When such conduct is pursued
what engagements will remain inviolate? I leave you
to judge on whose part treaties and promises have been
broken. You are acquainted with all things, it is right
to act with prudence and foresight.”</p>

<p>There is every reason to believe that on his return
Schwartz not only discharged his mission but exhorted
the authorities to play their part with honesty and
straightforwardness, and this was not perhaps a welcome
or acceptable admonition. Of this remarkable visit not a
record remains in the archives of the Company; possibly
had such a faithful note been made it would have been
a witness against the provocation and trickery which
marred their administration. But Schwartz had done his
duty and again he refused any personal advantage, even
handing over to the Board at Madras the three hundred
rupees given him by Hyder. All he would agree to was
that an English orphan school might be built with some
of it at Tanjore.</p>

<p>Probably amongst the most distinguished of native
rulers the name of Hyder Ali stands pre-eminent. He has
been called the Napoleon of India, and considering his
limitations as an Oriental, if only from the brilliance of
his military tactics and personality among his armies, he
may deserve that high comparison. It is easy to denounce
him as a bloodthirsty tyrant, and much of his character
justifies that condemnation, but he had other traits which
in fairness must be remembered. He lived in an age and
a country where duplicity in politics was the rule rather
than the exception, yet it is to his credit that he kept
his word with the English, who were not always equally
considerate as regards their obligations with him.
Mounted on his white elephant in his gaudy uniform of
white satin and gold flowers, vain of display as all his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
fathers were, he was the idol of his troops, who were
animated by the example of a man who had no fear
and exposed himself to any risks in leading them to
victory.</p>

<p>The victim of sensuality, he yet kept his head clear
for business, and though he could not read a word he
dictated several letters at the same time and his
marvellous memory kept him always in touch with the
financial and political affairs of his kingdom. Schwartz
has given us a picture of his court, and his interview
represents Hyder in one of his best moods. He seemed
a very Gallio in his religious views and used the Brahmin
because it suited his purpose to be guided by the ablest
and only educated men. There is no doubt he misled the
pious Schwartz in letting him imagine that those boys
were the objects of his charity and tender care. As a
matter of fact, they simply represented his practice of
carrying captive the young natives of any country which
came into his hands. He was cruelly severe in his
discipline and did not spare his own son when it was
needed; his ferocity of revenge and his lust of plunder
made him an unsparing enemy and an avaricious thief.
And yet, as we have seen in his talk with Schwartz, there
was a better side of him and he had a desire at least
after truth and justice. It is quite a natural question,
when reviewing such a character, to ask oneself what
Hyder Ali might have been had he embraced the Christian
faith.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE STRAIN BEGINS TO TELL.</p>


<p>The truce which followed the visit of Schwartz to Hyder
Ali was short lived. While the missionary, not without
many misgivings, had returned to complete his church and
care for his flock, the storm clouds were already on the
horizon. His health he finds is not quite so good, the
arduous travelling and exposure, in addition to constant
preaching work, has begun to tell on him. He complains
in some of his letters of pains in his shoulder and side. He
is thankful that he can still go out as usual. “For
though I was not confined,” he writes, “my right arm
gave me so much pain that I was unfit to write, nay to
hold a book with it. But now it is much better by the
mercy of God. He is the author and preserver of our
lives.”</p>

<p>“If He be pleased to let us stand for some time O may
He grant us strength to live to His glory and praise! Our
time is in His hand.” He is shocked at the luxurious and
sinful life which the Europeans are living, careless and
corrupt, on the edge of a volcano but blind to consequences.
This degeneration in the character of the white men utterly
discredited them in the dark watchful eyes of the natives.
The tearing up of treaties and breaking of solemn promises
had exasperated Hyder Ali and made him resolve to sweep
the English with their rotten government into the sea. His
ambition was like a roaring furnace; while the enemies
were fiddling and dancing he was preparing the immense
army of nearly an hundred thousand well trained men, led
by French officers and equipped for immediate battle. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
swept onward, wasting, burning, killing, behind him a
smoking desolation and before him a terror struck and
fleeing people. His objective was Madras and then a clean
sweep of the enemy all through the Carnatic. It seems
inconceivable that the Government could, from sheer
apathy, wilful ignorance and vicious living, become so incompetent
as to make no provision for defence and take no
notice of impending doom until the black clouds of smoke
and lurid flames almost reached the City. Here is the
comment of Schwartz upon the position:</p>

<p>“Our leaders pursued other things; the welfare of the
public was entirely forgotten, private interests, pleasure,
luxury were come to a stupendous height. They were
warned three months before Hyder’s invasion but they
despised the warning saying, ‘Hyder might as well fly as
come into the Carnatic!’ None could persuade them to
the contrary till they saw his horse at their garden houses.
Then consternation seized them, nothing but confusion was
visible. Hyder pursued his plan, took one fort after
another, till he got possession of Arcot.... Now what
is to be done? I say with Jeremy! ‘Be thou not terrible
unto me, O God’. This calamity is from the Lord and
doubtless He intends to purge us from our sins and take
away our dross ... our infidelity, our contempt of divine
things is beyond description and brings upon us the wrath
of God. Heathens and nominal Christians were asleep
and minding nothing but the things of this world. Who
knows but they may arise on hearing the thundering voice
of the law.”</p>

<p>The grain stores having been destroyed by the enemy,
no seed was sown, no harvest could be reaped, and famine,
gaunt and deadly, stalked through the land. No strong
men were left, only wandering skeletons were met within
the miserable and devastated villages. Hyder carried off
the healthy children and the flower of the people, the rest
were left to die, as Schwartz says: “When passing through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
the streets early in the morning, the dead were lying in
heaps on the dunghills.” And here in this extremity we
see the forethought and practical wisdom of Schwartz.
With the anticipation of such a famine he had purchased
twelve thousand bushels of rice, and when it seemed as if
the soldiers would die for want of food, he went to the
natives, who had lost all confidence in the word of a
European, and got them to bring in their animals and
stores, making himself personally responsible that they
should be duly paid. “I afterwards settled with the
natives and they went home quite satisfied. The Lord also
enabled me to consider the poor, so that I had it in my
power to feed a large number for the space of seventeen
months.”</p>

<p>“Our fort,” he writes, “contained the best part of the
inhabitants of the country, who flocked hither to escape
the unrelenting cruelty of the enemy. Daily we conversed
with these people and tried to convince them of the
vanity of their idols and to induce them to return to
the living God. They readily own the superior excellence
of the Christian doctrine, but remain in their deplorable
errors for various frivolous reasons. It were to be wished
that the country people having suffered nearly four years
all manners of calamity would consider the things which
belong to their eternal welfare, for which my assistants
pray and labour in conjunction with me. But though this
fruit of our labour has not hitherto answered our wishes,
still I am happy in being made an instrument of Providence
to instruct some and to warn others. Who knows but there
may come a time when others may reap what we are
sowing.”</p>

<p>This was the period when another crisis had arisen in
the great political drama of Indian history, and again, to
save the situation, another great Englishman entered the
field. What Clive had won, it was the duty of Warren
Hastings to hold and make sure. He had not only to stem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
the warlike onrush of a man like Hyder Ali but he had to
counterplot and play successfully the wily stratagems of
native intrigue. He saved the Company from bankruptcy
and made the path of English government safe and possible
in India, yet he ended sadly, harried to death by the bitterness
of his enemies at home, and the proud head, which
overawed the East, bowed in heart-break in his native
land.</p>

<p>Of Warren Hastings it has been truly said as regards
these closing years of persecution and bitterness:</p>

<p>“His life, his heroism, his proud reserve and confident
assurance that all his failings and faults arose from a
single-minded desire to carry out the intentions of his
time, are summed up in the words by which he declared
his own vindication and his accuser’s condemnation:</p>

<p>“‘I gave you all, and you have rewarded me with
confiscation, disgrace and a life of impeachment.’”</p>

<p>This terrible fighting gave evidence of the high regard
in which Schwartz was held by both combatants. It is
perhaps not surprising that the English whose cause he had
served so well in a diplomatic mission should be glad to
give him every advantage, but it is remarkable that a
tyrant like Hyder Ali should give orders to his officers “to
permit the venerable padre to pass unmolested and to show
him respect and kindness, for he is a holy man and means
no harm to my government.”</p>

<p>The death of Hyder Ali in 1782 did not end the war.
His son Tippoo, exceeding his father in cruelty and
vindictive oppression, was inspired to retrieve his reverses
and carry the conflict against the English to the bitter
end. For a time, however, the tide of war was against his
arms and, the French troops having left him on the
declaration of peace in Europe, the English Commander
Fullerton was advancing upon Mysore itself, when he was
stopped by the half hearted policy of the Madras Government,
who had received from Tippoo a request for peace.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
Once more in their difficulty an appeal was made, this
time by Lord Macartney, to Schwartz, that he should
accompany the commissioners on their visit to Tippoo’s
camp, to which, for the same just reasons as before, he
agreed. At the same time he pointed out in plainest terms
the folly of stopping Colonel Fullerton when he had an
enemy at a disadvantage, and forecasted further trouble, if
indeed it did not render his mission futile. In his
conversation with this brave officer he fully sympathised
with him in the disappointment and greatly regretted the
step that had been taken.</p>

<p>In writing to the Madras Government Colonel Fullerton
in a very handsome manner acknowledged the value of the
service of the missionary.</p>

<p>“On our second march we were visited by the Rev. Mr.
Schwartz whom your Lordship and the Board requested to
proceed as a faithful interpreter between Tippoo and the
commissioners. The knowledge and the integrity of this
irreproachable missionary have retrieved the character of
the Europeans from imputations of general depravity.”</p>

<p>The attempt to reach Tippoo in accordance with Lord
Macartney’s wishes was frustrated by the turning back of
Schwartz for some unknown reason, whether it was
because, unlike his father, Tippoo, in his desire to insult
an Englishman, did not hesitate to show disrespect to this
aged missionary, or because he did not mean to confer
until the district of Mangalore was in his possession.
Schwartz said that he would have been very glad to have
helped to make peace but he was thankful he was spared
the strain for he was far from well, and when a further
request was made he felt justified in declining it. Though
he could not go himself he prayed earnestly that the
commissioners might be guided aright in their interview
with this violent man. He also sees behind all this what
a tragedy of misery, sin and cruelty is going on.</p>

<p>“I entreat God to bless them,” he says, “with wisdom,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
resolution and integrity, to settle the business to the
welfare of this poor country. But alas! We ourselves
are so divided—one pulls one way, the other quite a
different one. When one considers all, high and low, rich
and poor, rulers and those that are ruled, one is struck
with grief and a variety of passions. What blindness,
insensibility, and obstinacy, greediness, and rapaciousness.
A thousand times I think with myself: ‘Good God, must
all these people <i>die</i>—must they all give a strict account
of their lives—must they all appear before the tribunal
of Jesus, the mediator and judge? How little do they
mind their end, and the consequences of their lives?’”</p>

<p>There is no doubt that at this time Schwartz was feeling
the effect of his long life of incessant work, and in his
letters to his friends he asks their prayers that more
strength may be given him. He tells that while at present
in no position of pain, his weakness is great and that speaking
or walking so fatigue him that he can hardly stand.
He has spent so many years in the work, under a trying
climate, without any furlough, that it is no wonder that
he begins to fail under the burden of a labour he has borne
so long. Not that he complained; Schwartz was one of
those men who consider themselves last and scorn to make
much of either their physical pains or their difficult
circumstances. He dismisses the question of his illness
with almost an apology for referring to it.</p>

<p>“Enough of this, age comes upon me, I have no reason
therefore to wonder at weakness. If the mind be sound
all is well, the rest we shall quit when we enter into the
grave. That will cure all our bodily indispositions....
Our time is short. Within some days I have sojourned in
this country thirty-four years. The end of my journey is,
even according to the course of nature, near. May I not
flag! May my last days be my best!”</p>

<p>Few missionaries either then or since have preached so
many sermons, every one worked out with so much carefulness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
and so rich in thought. And yet he had no time
to prepare in the ordinary sense; he never wrote out his
sermons and was content with putting on a piece of paper
the principal points of his discourse, which was otherwise
quite extempore. From one of these notes a brief extract
will be interesting; he is speaking on the condition of a
believer and how love, his favourite theme, must be
paramount in his heart. “Let us now represent a person
truly believing in Jesus and united to Him, washed from
his sins, strengthened by His Spirit, and cheered with the
hope of an unspeakably glorious crown hereafter. Being
endowed with such a gracious faith and lively hope, what
shall he do? What will be the effect of such a faith or
hope? Love towards God and all men. A person that is
blessed with such faith and hope cannot but love God and
all mankind and that from the bottom of his heart. He
looks upon God as his Father who has loved him in an
unspeakable manner, who sent His only begotten Son into
the world for his eternal happiness, who has called him out
of darkness into marvellous light, who has blessed him with
pardon, peace and hope, and this heartily inclines him to
love Him sincerely and ardently. The conclusion which
St. John draws from the love of God towards us is very
natural. ‘We love him because he first loved us.’ Such
a Christian will esteem and venerate, adore and praise God,
keep His commandments, His Sabbath Day, His word.
Love will teach him all this. His soul and body he will
present as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto God,
which will be his reasonable service. Such an one will not
be conformed to this world but transformed by the renewing
of his mind, that he may prove what is that good and
acceptable and perfect will of God. Whether he eats or
drinks, or whatever he does, he will endeavour to do it to
the glory of God.</p>

<p>“Let us seriously examine our hearts and lives whether
we have loved God in such a manner. Have we venerated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
Him and His Divine Name above all? Have we delighted
in Him so as to renounce sinful pleasures? Have we
endeavoured to glorify God or to promote the honour of
His Name among those with whom we live? Have we
worshipped Him privately and publicly, in such a manner
as to inspire others with devotion? Have we kept the
Lord’s Day in a holy manner?</p>

<p>“And as he loves God he will likewise love his neighbour,
and that not only externally but from his heart.
The sense of the love of God will be to him instead of a
thousand commandments. He will love the souls of his
fellow creatures, the ignorant he will instruct by word and
example, the wicked he will endeavour to convert and lead
them into the path of pity; the poor and afflicted he will
assist, nourish and comfort, according to the ability which
God hath given him. He will take care not to offend or
injure his neighbour, either in his fortune or his name. So
that backbiting, envy, strife, malice will be far from him,
and all this will flow from a principle of faith and hope.</p>

<p>“What a happiness it would be if all Christians were
actuated by such love or desire of making others happy
here and hereafter!</p>

<p>“Let us therefore ask you seriously before that God
who knows your hearts and ways, do you love your neighbours
sincerely? Is it the bent of your lives not only to
honour your God but likewise to make your fellow
creatures happy? Have you showed a tender regard to
their eternal welfare? You see thousands before your
eyes sitting in darkness and the shadow of death. Have
you endeavoured at least by your example to convince
them of the purity and excellence of your religion? Have
you discouraged vice and wickedness or have you promoted
it and so laid a stumbling block before your ignorant and
careless fellow-creatures? Have you assisted the poor and
needy in their distressful circumstances or have you been
regardless of their misery?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>“Let us examine our hearts seriously and whatever we
find in our behaviour to have been against the will of God
let us immediately repent of it and beg forgiveness in the
name of Jesus Christ. Cultivate these three principles,
faith, hope, and love, and you will glorify God, enjoy true
happiness and edify your fellow-creatures—which God
grant!”</p>

<p>Travelling into Tinnevelley, we find Schwartz busy
establishing a Christian church at Palamcotta where a
number of converts had gathered together and with the
help of some English gentlemen had built a little church,
and here he preached to a good congregation, with eighty
persons, to whom he administered the Sacrament. He is
not, however, unmindful of the need of discipline and some
elements in the church were rather unsatisfactory. “But
this,” he adds, “is no more than what are usually united
together, wheat and chaff.”</p>

<p>The worldliness of the European residents was always
a disturbing aspect in the eyes of Schwartz, and writing to
his friend Mr. Chambers on 20th July, 1785, he speaks of
these things, knowing that his correspondent as an earnest
Christian will appreciate what he says:</p>

<p>“How much is squandered away in what is called
fashionable living, to no purpose but rather to the worst!
Health, strength, conscience, and the sweetest sense of the
favour of God are lost—for what! Though we are not
to serve God for the sake of temporal advantages, we shall
find that true unfeigned ‘godliness’ is profitable even to
all things, having promise of the life that now is and of
that which is to come! The people of the world love both.
Their tumultuous mirth does not deserve the name of joy
and is always closely attended and embittered by unspeakable
disquietude and anxiety, which they must feel so soon
as they begin to reflect....</p>

<p>“Be this our aim—and may our hearts (ah! our
slippery hearts) never swerve from the path to that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
heavenly Canaan! May we never murmur or lust after
the things which we have once renounced! May we be
faithful unto death and so realize the crown of life!
Remember me likewise when you come before the throne of
mercy that my approaching age may not be unfruitful but
blessed.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, matters were not very settled in Tanjore, and
Schwartz on his return found the people almost in rebellion
and the Rajah in great straits because the Government at
Madras were pressing him for tribute. All was turmoil
and the political atmosphere was charged with storm, into
the midst of which the old missionary came to bring a little
peace and confidence. His first duty was to write to Sir
John Macpherson, the Governor-General, and put in a plea
for a more tender consideration for his old friend the
Rajah, notwithstanding all his shortcomings.</p>

<p>“Now my dear sir,” he writes, “will you permit an
old friend to intercede for this poor country and the
dejected Rajah, requesting not to use violent or coercive
measures to get the immediate payment of the arrears,
which would throw the country into a deplorable and
ruinous state, but rather to admonish him to rule his
subjects with more justice and equity.”</p>

<p>We get from his letters at this period references to the
political trouble which was making his efforts as a
missionary very difficult, the people resenting oppression,
the policy of the English represented by the Company
changing continually with the fluctuation of their alliance
with the native rulers, agriculture at a standstill, and the
sepoys in a state of mutiny because they can get no pay.
“It is truly melancholy,” he writes, “that nothing but
fear will incline us to do justice to them. By these means<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
all discipline is relaxed, the officers lose that respect which
is due to their rank and station, and the Sepoys become
insolent. This has been the case not only in time of war,
but now in the time of peace. May God help us to consider
the things which belong to our peace in all respects.” But
amidst these difficulties he works hard to consolidate the
little gatherings of Christians which look to him as a
spiritual father and is busy with the schools, the interest
of the children always lying so near his heart. Schwartz
is full of faith, and his sunny presence brings confidence
and hope wherever he goes; of such a man one might well
say that he was a happy saint with an optimistic view
under the most depressing circumstances. In so many
respects he was ahead of his age, seeing possibilities which
had not yet been revealed to the few Missionary Societies
existing, at any rate in England, and drawing confidence
and encouragement from the Society for Promoting
Christian Knowledge, which had so well supported him in
all his aims.</p>

<p>Still the old heart searchings kept him very humble;
his letters, with scarcely an exception, indicate this
increasing sense of need of watchfulness and a quiet
walking with God. He reminds a friend that what we
want is not so much urgent petition to God in difficulty
and peril but a steadfast resting upon Him, in personal and
unbroken converse. He quotes how a friend once asked
Francke of the Orphan House at Halle how he kept his
peace of mind. The reply was “By stirring up my mind
a hundred times a day! Wherever I am, whatever I do,
I say ‘Blessed Jesus, have I truly a share in Thy redemption?
Are my sins forgiven? Am I guided by Thy
Spirit? Thine I am. Wash me again and again.
Strengthen me.’ By this constant converse with Jesus I
have enjoyed serenity of mind and a settled peace in my
heart.”</p>

<p>In reviewing his work from time to time he thanks God<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
for the practical evidence of the word preached to the
soldiers in his capacity as chaplain to the garrison at
Tanjore. Both on Sunday and week evening services the
men come in good numbers. “To this they are encouraged
by their officers, who all confessed that corporal punishments
had ceased from the time that the regiment began
to relish religious instruction.”</p>

<p>He found less encouragement in dealing with Tuljajee,
the Rajah of Tanjore, who, broken in health and spirit,
the victim of vice and rapacity, mourning miserably the
loss of his son, was rapidly going downhill. His
servants were doing as they liked, and a new Sirkeel or
principal officer, named Baba, was helping himself to the
treasury, oppressing the poor down-trodden people.
Schwartz would stand no nonsense from this man. In a
letter to the English resident, Mr. Huddleston, he strongly
denounces him. “If the Rajah will let him go on in this
manner, my being a mediator is hypocrisy. The Rajah
and Baba are entirely mistaken if they think that I would
sacrifice truth or integrity to oppression and low cunning.
I am heartily tired of their behaviour and shall mention it
in plainest terms to them and the governor.” In the end
the Government were compelled to take charge of
Tanjore and in its administration asked Schwartz to take a
seat on the Committee with this well deserved compliment:
“Happy indeed would it be for this country, for the
Company and for the Rajah himself, when his eyes should
be open, if he possessed the whole authority and were
invested with power to execute all the measures that his
wisdom and benevolence would suggest.” He accepted this
honorary position on condition that he was to be a party
to no coercive measures towards the unfortunate Rajah; at
the same time he will not allow his friendly interest in the
past to bias him as to his attitude of injustice towards his
people. “This I have declared more than once, when I
humbly entreated him to have mercy on his subjects, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
which plain declaration I lost in some degree his good
opinion.” Soon this ruler found that his people would
have nothing to do with his promises of amendment and
began to leave the country in despair. The Rajah appealed
to Schwartz to intervene on his behalf and such was his
personal influence that seven thousand of these emigrants
returned again to their homes, saying to the aged missionary,
their true friend, “As you have shown kindness to
us, we intend to work night and day to manifest our regard
for you.”</p>

<p>Amongst the many friends and fellow-workers of
Schwartz, the name of his young pastor, John Caspar
Kohlhoff, will ever be associated. He was the son of the
venerable John Balthasar Kohlhoff who for fifty years had
laboured so well and faithfully in the field. It is not
surprising that Schwartz took such a special interest in this
young man, for he was his son in the faith. He speaks of
this with great simplicity and thankfulness: “From his
younger years I instructed him in Christianity, English,
German and some country languages. Having been
instructed for several years it pleased God to awaken him
to a sense of his own sinfulness and to raise in his mind a
hunger and thirst after the righteousness of Jesus. He
then prayed, wept and meditated, and in short he became
a very agreeable companion to me. His improvement in
knowledge I observed with delight.”</p>

<p>And now at Tranquebar on the 23rd of January, 1787,
a large congregation is gathered of Europeans and their
families, with the native Christians, to the Ordination
Service of this young missionary of promise. His old
father sits by his side and Schwartz preaches the sermon
from 2 Tim. ii. 1: “Thou therefore my son be strong
in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.” After his ordination
the young preacher ascended the pulpit and preached in
Tamil and the meeting concluded with some faithful words
from the missionaries present and the sacramental service.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
It was most impressive and it is a pleasure to know that
the ministry thus begun was continued through many
years of faithful and successful work.</p>

<p>The interest of Schwartz in another young man, in this
instance a native prince, forms one of the most striking
incidents of his work. It shows the tenderness and
fatherly care, the fearless loyalty to the right and the wise
direction which the old missionary devoted to one who
never forgot his protector and friend. The story of
Serfogee must be told here.</p>

<p>Tuljajee, the Rajah, according to the custom of his
country, being now childless, for he had lost by death his
son, his daughter, and his grandson, adopted as son the
ten-year-old boy of his cousin and, after formally acquainting
the English governor of the fact, on the 26th January,
1787, he sent for Schwartz to bless the child. “This is
not my son,” said he, “but yours, into your hands I deliver
him.” And the old missionary reverently replies: “May
this child become a child of God.” Later on with much
emotion the Rajah begs a favour of his friend: “I appoint
you guardian of this child, I intend to give him over to
your care, or literally to put his hands into yours.”</p>

<p>But Schwartz hesitated to take this responsibility,
pointing out to the Rajah how he was leaving this boy with
a support “like a garden without a fence,” and amid the
bickerings and jealousies of the palace his life would be
endangered and it would be difficult to protect him, though
he would gladly see him from time to time. He urged him
to make his brother the proper guardian of the boy. “You
have a brother,” Schwartz said, “deliver the child to him,
charge him to educate and treat him as his own son till
he is grown up. Thus his health and life may be preserved
and the welfare of the country may be secured.” To this
advice the old Rajah strongly objected at first, for this
brother of his was not by any means a satisfactory relative,
even his legitimacy was doubtful, and it was only after an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
interview with his mother, who strongly supported the
proposition of Schwartz, that it was agreed to.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that Schwartz rejected this offer of
the guardianship of Serfogee because it would have placed
him in a position of political responsibility in the government
of the country, amounting to a regency. This, of
course, would be quite incompatible with his work as a
missionary. The position was a very difficult and embarrassing
one, needing the utmost caution, for, on the one
hand, Schwartz was anxious to stand by the boy at the
affecting request of the Rajah (who had evidently not much
longer to live), and, on the other hand, he must hold himself
aloof from any entanglements as regards the conduct
of the country during his minority. But it will be seen how
lovingly and faithfully the old missionary until the day
of his death fulfilled the moral guardianship of Serfogee
which he from that moment accepted as a solemn charge.
The next morning the decrepit and worn out Rajah
summoned the English resident, Mr. Huddleston, and
Colonel Stuart, the Commander of the garrison, with Mr.
Schwartz to his chamber, where his brother and Serfogee
with the principal officers were also assembled. He
explained his will as regards the boy, agreed to his brother
acting as Regent, but when Serfogee was old enough to
take the throne, he trusted the Company would “maintain
him and his heirs on the throne as long as the sun and
moon should endure.” He was told by his visitors that
this would be done and then he exclaimed: “This assurance
comforts me in my last hours.”</p>

<p>A few days afterwards the old man died, and, although
his body was burned, no woman mounted the pile
to die, a significant fact, seeing that at this time the
suttee was still the practice of the law. Troubles
soon arose, however, over the succession; Ameer Sing
was not disposed to act as simply regent and guardian,
and eventually the Governor was persuaded to refer the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
question of title to a meeting of pundits, who, under the
influence of bribes, reported that by the religious laws of
the Shasters Ameer Sing should take the throne. For a
time things went well, Schwartz was allowed to build
schools and the money promised under the will of the late
Rajah was supplied. Wherever Schwartz went the importance
of providing schools for the native boys and girls was
uppermost in his thoughts. At Vepery, where Lady
Campbell had established an asylum for female orphans,
he was much interested. “The children read to me,” he
writes, “showed me their copy-books, their sewing and
knitting, and recited their catechism. I expressed a wish
to catechise them (by extemporaneous questions), but they
were not accustomed to it. I observed ‘that mere learning
by head would be of very little use to the children.’
‘True,’ Lady Campbell answered, ‘but where shall we find
persons to catechise them in a useful manner?’ I have
often mentioned this subject since and trust that God will
point out the means.” To these institutions the Government
at Madras made liberal contributions and Schwartz
asked for the same support to be granted to Tanjore. He
saw how the provincial schools were succeeding at Palamcotta.
These were not places where the doctrines of
Christianity were taught but he always appreciated the
indirect advantage to the spiritual welfare which these
institutions obtained. His words are wise and explicit in
speaking of the value of such schools. “They consist
chiefly,” he says, in writing to the Society, “of children of
Brahmins and merchants who read and write English.
Their intention doubtless is to learn the English language
with a view to their temporal welfare, but they thereby
become better acquainted with good principles. No
deceitful methods are used to bring them over to the saving
doctrines of Christ; though the most earnest wishes are
entertained that they may all come to the knowledge of
God and of Jesus Christ whom He hath sent.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>At Tanjore one of these schools was filled with children
from the best families, and the young men from the
seminaries obtained good situations under the Government
at Madras. Schwartz looked forward to developing in this
direction a residential academy for catechists and was very
anxious to start a provincial school at Combaconum, which
was a very idolatrous place. But with the Rajah Ameer
Sing he did not find such a favourable reception of his
plans as with the old King Tuljajee, his predecessor. On
this point he had the following conversation: “I spoke
with the Rajah on the subject, but he seemed not to approve
of it and afterwards sent to inform me of his disapprobation.
I went to him and inquired how it was that he did
not approve of it, especially when everyone was left at
liberty to have Hindustani, Persian, Mahratta, and
Malabar Schools. ‘But,’ I said, ‘the true reason of your
disapprobation is a fear that many would be converted to
the Christian religion. I wish you would all devote yourselves
to the service of the true God. I have assisted you
in many troubles and will you now treat me as an enemy?
Is this right?’ He answered, ‘No, that is not my
meaning, but it has never been the custom.’ ‘Ought it
then,’ I replied, ‘always to remain so? There has been
much done already that never was the custom.’ He said,
‘Good, good, I will do it.’”</p>

<p>One of the difficulties which exercised his mind
especially at this time was the question of caste and here
again his far sighted policy endeavoured to bring the
people together, especially in divine worship. One day
while waiting to see the Rajah a Brahmin challenged him,
“Mr. Schwartz, do you not think it a very bad thing to
touch a Pariah?” “O yes,” he replied, “a very bad
thing.” The Brahmin saw that something more was
meant by his answer, so he said, “But, Mr. Schwartz, what
do you mean by a Pariah?” “I mean,” was the rejoinder,
“a thief, a liar, a slanderer, a drunkard, an adulterer, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
proud man.” “O then,” said the Brahmin hastily, “we
are all Pariahs!”</p>

<p>Meanwhile the new Rajah of Tanjore was causing
increased trouble; history was repeating itself, for he had
appointed an unscrupulous man as his sirkeel who also
simply exacted bribes and corrupted justice. Schwartz
promptly reported this state of things to the Government
at Madras and it was decided to administer the state with
the help of Schwartz and Mr. Petrie, a commissioner.
This led to a strong remonstrance against the confinement
of the boy Serfogee in what was equal to a prison and the
neglect and unkind treatment he received. There was
little doubt that Ameer Sing, who had taken such solemn
pledges to protect and care for him, had intended to hide
him away and if possible get rid of him. It was a moment
of peril for the boy and demanded instant action.
Schwartz, with an English gentleman, went to the palace,
asked for Serfogee and taking him by the hand told him
to follow. The Rajah, alarmed, implored that the boy
should not be removed, promising that he should be well
cared for. Schwartz consented, but slept by the boy all
night and never left him until twelve sepoys of the 23rd
Regiment were set to guard. Schwartz afterwards wrote
a long report to the Council at Madras, narrating the
corrupt condition of the Rajah’s government and that it
was imperative that the boy should be placed in more
security, be properly educated and provided for. Not only
so, but Schwartz prepared and submitted a clear and most
able plan for the administration of justice in Tanjore.
This long and statesmanlike document is a proof of his
remarkable knowledge and experience of the needs of the
people. “It is acknowledged,” he writes, “that the
administration of justice is the basis of the true welfare
of a country.”</p>

<p>But this excellent reform, while appreciated by the
Government at Madras, did not find equal favour at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
court of Tanjore. The Rajah, dissipated, diseased and
weak minded, was more and more in the hands of the
rapacious intriguing people around him, nominally his
servants but really his masters.</p>

<p>In the meantime Schwartz pursued his work in spite of
many hindrances, opening fresh schools and utilizing the
native catechists. One of these was ordained at this time,
Sattianaden, a man of high character and some talents.
Schwartz, writing of his qualifications for the work of a
minister, gives him high praise, “His whole deportment
evinces clearly the integrity of his heart. His humble,
disinterested and believing walk has been made so evident
to me and others that I may say with truth I have never
met with his equal among the natives in this country. His
love to Christ and his desire to be useful to his countrymen
are quite apparent. His gifts in preaching afford universal
satisfaction. His love to the poor is extraordinary.”</p>

<p>The ordination of Sattianaden was a step of much
importance, for it inaugurated a new era of utilizing native
help in the Indian mission field. His sermon was
considered by the Society for Promoting Christian
Knowledge to be worthy of publication and he was also
much cheered by a very kind letter the secretary sent him
with the good wishes of the Society for the success of his
ministry. In a letter to Mr. Jaenické, his fellow worker at
Palamcotta, Sattianaden makes a grateful and affectionate
reference to Schwartz.</p>

<p>“When I contemplate the ways of God by which He
led me I am full of admiration and praise. I was once a
heathen, who did not know Him and He called me by His
faithful servant Mr. Schwartz. This, my venerable father,
received and instructed me. His exertions by day and
night tended to bring me to repentance towards God and
faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ, to produce in me
fruits meet for repentance, to induce me to lead a Godly
and holy life and to grow in knowledge and in every grace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
and virtue. He did not destine me to worldly concerns
but appointed me to bring my nation to the knowledge of
God and of Jesus Christ whom He sent to redeem the
world.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile the work at Tanjore progressed. Schwartz
mentions with thankfulness that in the year when he
attained the age of sixty-five no less than eighty-seven
heathen had been baptized and that he had heartily
welcomed the new missionary Mr. Caemmerer at
Tranquebar, who had begun well. This new comer,
writing home, speaks of the anticipation he felt of meeting
Schwartz and how his heart was kindled when that hope
was realized. His letters contain a few pictures of the old
veteran. “Sincere esteem and reverence penetrated my
soul when I saw this worthy man with his snow white hair.
Integrity and truth beamed in his eyes. He embraced me
and thanked God that He had lead me to this country....
Nothing could possibly afford me more lively satisfaction
than the society of Mr. Schwartz. His unfeigned piety,
his real and conscientious attention to every branch of his
duties, his sincerity—in short, his whole demeanour fills
me with reverence and admiration. He treated me like a
brother or rather like a tender parent and instructed me in
the most agreeable manner in the Malabar language....
Many an evening passed away as if it had been but a single
moment, so exceedingly interesting proved the conversation
of this truly venerable man and his relations of the
singular and merciful guidance of God, of which he had
experienced so many proofs throughout his life, but
particularly during the dreadful wars of India. The
account he gave of the many dangers to which his life had
been exposed and the wonderful manner in which it was
often preserved, his tender and grateful affection towards
God, his fervent prayers and thanksgivings, his gentle
exhortations constantly to live as in the presence of God,
zealously to preach the Gospel and entirely to resign ourselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
to God’s kind providence—all this brought many a
tear into my eyes and I could not but ardently wish that
I might one day resemble Schwartz. His disinterestedness,
his honourable manner of conducting public business,
procured him the general esteem both of Europeans and
Hindus. Every one loved and respected him, from the
King of Tanjore to the humblest native.</p>

<p>“Nor was he less feared, for he reproved them without
respect to situation and rank when their conduct deserved
condemnation, and he told all persons, without distinction,
what they ought to do and what to avoid, to promote their
temporal and eternal welfare. The King frequently
observed that in this world much was affected by presents
and gold, and he himself had done much by these means, but
that with Padre Schwartz they answered no purpose....
His garden is filled from morning till late in the evening
with natives of every rank who come to him to have their
differences settled, but rather than his missionary duties
should be neglected the most important cases were delayed.</p>

<p>“Both morning and evening he has a service at which
many of the Christians attend. A short hymn is first sung,
after which he gives an exhortation on some passage of
Scripture and concludes with a prayer. Till this is over,
everyone, even the most respectable, is obliged to wait.
The number of those who come to him to be instructed in
Christianity is great. Every day individuals attend,
requesting his Society to establish a Christian congregation
in their part of the country.</p>

<p>“During my stay, about thirty persons, who had
previously been instructed, were baptized. He always
performs the service with such solemnity that all present
are moved to tears. He has certainly received from God
a most peculiar gift of teaching the truths of religion.
Heathens of the highest rank, who never intend to become
worshippers of the true God and disciples of Jesus Christ,
hear his instructions with pleasure. During an abode of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
more than forty years in this country, he has acquired a
profound knowledge of the customs, manners and character
of the people. He expresses himself in the Tamil language
as correctly as a native. He can immediately reply to any
question and refutes objections so well that the people
acknowledge ‘We can lay nothing to the charge of this
priest.’”</p>

<p>One of the problems which often exercised the mind of
Schwartz was how to find employment for his converts, a
difficulty which is no stranger to the mission field to-day.
In more senses than one the native Christian has to begin
life all over again. In some cases he has made material
sacrifices which he can never recover, but to all there is the
right to live and the need for supplying its common
necessaries. In his journal under date 1791 Schwartz
makes a brief mention of the action taken in this respect:</p>

<p>“I sometimes employ poor widows in spinning. They
bring the yarn to a Christian weaver, who makes good cloth
for a trifling sum. Some widows bruise rice and sell it,
others support themselves by selling fruit. When I visit
these poor women on an afternoon I first catechise them
and then get them to show me their work, as a proof of
their industry. Labour is constantly necessary for them,
not only as an occupation but to fix their minds on an
object during their hours of solitude.</p>

<p>“The great wish of our heart is, that those who have
been instructed in our religion may lead a life conformable
to its holy precepts. Some indeed bring forth the fruits
of faith, as for others we labour with patience, in hope of
seeing them turn to the Lord.”</p>

<p class="ph3">RESPONSIBILITIES AND PATIENCE.</p>


<p>Age was creeping on apace and almost every letter
written by Schwartz contains some reference to the filling
up of years and the nearness of eternity. But he is happy
enough in his work and in no haste to be gone. In saying
good-bye to his friend, Mr. Huddleston, who was returning
to England, broken in health, he gives him a little fatherly
counsel, in a letter dated 7th February, 1792, begging
him to practice patience and contentment and be quite
restful in the will of God.</p>

<p>“This lesson,” says he, “we learn with difficulty;
however, if we humble ourselves and believe as we ought,
that God directs all to our advantage, we shall willingly,
if not cheerfully, resign over our own will to His divine
and perfect will. You take now your farewell and I do
the same. Having lived nearly forty-two years in this
climate, my strength decreaseth and I look for a blessed
eternity.</p>

<p>“God has dealt kindly, very kindly, with me. He has
led me as a father, forgiven me ten thousand talents which
I owed Him, has given me a knowledge of His love and
the love of my Redeemer, has made me, unworthy
creature, an instrument of His grace to convey some
knowledge of the Redeemer to others; so that I have a
lively hope of finding some with whom I shall sing the
praises due to the blessed Jesus for ever and ever.</p>

<p>“To complain I have no cause; except when I
consider how often I have disobeyed Him. Then I have
reason enough to complain of myself. But I know the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
exceedingly great mercy of my God, who is willing to
cover my sins and to heal all my infirmities.</p>

<p>“You, my dear friend, are younger in years and may
still live for some time. I entreat you to give your whole
heart to Him, who can fill it with eternal joy. All worldly
goods are deficient in that respect. They may please us
but they cannot make us truly happy. Let us therefore
take our refuge in Him who has loved us and given Himself
for us. Live to His glory, and forget not that the true
disciples of Jesus crucify the flesh and the lusts of it. Be
guided by the blessed Spirit of God—trust not in your
own strength—watch and pray and the God of peace be
with you.</p>

<p>“May we see one another in a world where sin and
sorrow are not to be met with!”</p>

<p>While writing these farewell lines to his friend,
Schwartz enclosed another letter to his wife, whom he
had possibly never seen, but he feels that after spending
years of intimate friendship with her husband in India
he need make no apology for writing this letter to her.
Here also he gives judicious counsel and says some things
about the education of children which can never grow old
or out of date. He also laments the decline of loyalty
to Scriptural teaching which characterizes the theological
literature of his day. In both these respects this letter
would be quite as appropriate if written in our own times.
We have progressed and travelled far, and in many
respects India and England are so different that Schwartz
would rub his eyes were he to re-visit these lands to-day,
but the problems and the perils of the Church are, though
under a different guise, still the same to face and to solve
if we can in our own times. He is sending his blessing to
the circle of his friend’s family at home and writes:</p>

<p>“I must confess that the education which many
parents give their children is highly detrimental. Their
understandings are not furnished with divine knowledge,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
their wills are not bent to love and obey God, their
passions are not properly restrained or directed. At last
they grow up without fearing, obeying, and honouring
God, they are ashamed of showing anything relative to
true Christianity. They are taught to do their duty,
without knowing the source from which they ought to
draw strength.</p>

<p>“I find that in many of the latest publications the
atonement of the Redeemer and the divine operations of
the blessed Spirit of God, are altogether forgotten, nay
exploded. If the foundation of true Christianity is
destroyed, what superstructure can be raised? I therefore
cannot but entreat you to learn the way to heaven
from the Sermons of your Redeemer and the Epistles of
St. Paul and the other apostles. My favourite chapter is
the third of St. Paul’s Epistle to the Philippians. There
you will find the genuine character of a true Christian.</p>

<p>“All worldly things though not sinful in themselves,
appear to that exalted Christian as dross. He wishes to
find Christ as his treasure and greatest gain, by Whom he
has obtained mercy, pardon, peace, and the hope of everlasting
life.”</p>

<p>Schwartz began perceptibly to lose strength but not
heart. We gather this from a letter written by one of
the missionaries at Tranquebar who found it necessary to
seek his advice upon some matter and met him by
appointment at Tripatore.</p>

<p>“I reached that place,” he writes, “at seven and at
eight Mr. Schwartz arrived, whom I had so earnestly
desired to see. He was not able to quit his palanquin
without difficulty; and I soon perceived that, since I saw
him at Tanjore a year and a half ago, his energy and
strength had become much impaired. It went to my
very heart, as I reflected with sorrow that we were not
likely to retain this dear brother long amongst us. He
himself observed, ‘I am getting nearer the grave,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
travelling no longer does for me, my heavenly Father
will not I trust permit me to lie long sick and incapable
of work, but take me soon to Himself, if it be His will.’
He complained of a severe cold that affected his teeth,
the loss of which would much grieve him, as it would
hinder his speaking.”</p>

<p>Weary as he was, he had to brace up his energies
to face new and serious difficulties, one being the unsettled
and unsatisfactory arrangement as regards Serfogee. In
reply to many pathetic appeals beseeching his old friend’s
protection, Schwartz prevailed upon the Board of
Directors at Madras to send some soldiers to bring away
this unhappy young prince and also the two Royal
widows, and the whole matter was laid before Lord
Cornwallis, who at that time was finishing up an arduous
but successful campaign against Tippoo Sultan. But
unfortunately in the confusion and disagreement of the
ruling powers of that day, the pressing needs of his
case got shelved and indefinitely postponed. Ameer Sing,
with all his wrong-doing and shameless incompetency,
was allowed to continue on the throne of Tanjore for
four years more. By this time a state of anarchy existed.</p>

<p>A new complication arose: the poor subjects, jealous
of the peaceful character of the Christians and their
steadfast refusal to join in plundering expeditions,
encamped themselves with the avowed purpose of
extirpating Christianity, root and branch. Many of the
Christians, therefore, armed themselves in self-defence.
Once more, as peacemaker, Schwartz hurried to the scene
of action and by the spell of his personality persuaded
the malcontents to disarm and go back to their ploughing
and sowing on the fields. His grateful comment is “My
heart rejoiced at the kind over-ruling providence—surely
He is a God that heareth prayer.”</p>

<p>Although the rights of Serfogee were delayed, his
friend Schwartz, seeing that the comfort and even safety<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
of the young prince were in peril, obtained permission
to take him and the two widows away to Madras, and
on the 10th January, 1793, we find Schwartz leading a
troop of the Company’s soldiers into Tanjore, and, despite
the opposition of Ameer Sing, bringing the captives safely
away to a place of security.</p>

<p>It will be seen how frequently and with what success
Schwartz placed himself at the disposal of the Government,
but he was scrupulously careful to keep clear of
any money consideration. He knew only too well that a
missionary, undertaking by request the performance of
delicate political duties, might easily be suspected of
seeking his own advantage, especially in an age and place
where bribes, in some sort or another, were rather the rule
than the exception. But he could always plead his
disinterested aims.</p>

<p>“For two years,” he writes, “I have discharged the
duties of a resident. A resident usually receives 700 star
pagodas, or £300 sterling. I have not received anything
nor have I asked it.”</p>

<p>“My journey to Madras I undertook at the desire of
the Government, as tutor of Serfogee. The expenses of the
journey <i>I bore myself</i>. I was obliged for conscience’ sake
to undertake it, as the legal guardian of the young man.”</p>

<p>While he felt it his duty to assist the ruling powers at
any time when his influence might help the cause of peace
and the prosperity of the people, it was always his spiritual
work which held his heart in thrall. His supreme delight
was the proclamation of the Gospel, his vast parish took
in its range the countless souls of Southern India; whatever
their station or caste, high or low, philosophic or
ignorant and degraded, they all alike needed Christ and
that was enough for him. Here we get a little glimpse of
him in quite an ordinary scene of his busy life, as it
impressed Mr. Paezold, his fellow-worker and travelling
companion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>

<p>“We rested in the evening at Tripatore, a large
heathen place, distinguished by two celebrated idol
temples, which are situated on an eminence. Mr.
Schwartz embraced the opportunity of entering into a
conversation with a number of Brahmins and other
heathen. He addressed them in a most eloquent and
impressive manner, powerfully contrasting the follies and
corruptions of heathenism and the state of awful blindness
and delusion under which its professors laboured, with the
light and purity of the Christian religion and its perfect
accordance with the dictates of sound and enlightened
reason, and I observe with wonder and delight the
eagerness and attention with which the heathen
population listened to his instructive discourses. But to
attract and keep up such attention, one must really
possess the talents and influence of Mr. Schwartz—his
intimate acquaintance with the native language, his
prudence, experience, and commanding authority. For
a considerable time he continued his conversation in a
standing position, and though I did not sufficiently
understand the Malabar dialect, in which he addressed
the numerous assembly, I could still perceive from their
lips, their gestures, and the whole of their outward
deportment, how deeply interested they felt. Indeed,
when certain questions were proposed and certain answers
given I repeatedly heard them exclaim, ‘Surely this is
true, this is right, thus it should be!’</p>

<p>“The shades of night were coming on and Mr.
Schwartz was preparing to retire to a resting place but
the people wished to detain him still longer.</p>

<p>“‘Stay with us,’ was their exclamation; ‘we wish to
listen to you further. Sit down both of you, you are
tired of standing.’</p>

<p>“We therefore sat on the steps of one of their temples,
near an enormous idol car, which during their festivals
is sometimes drawn by two or three thousand people. Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
Schwartz protracted his address for another half hour,
and when he left them they all united in thanking him
for the pains bestowed upon them. But should you,
however, ask such people afterwards, what reason they
would assign for not embracing a doctrine which it was
impossible for them to refute and which they could not
help pronouncing truly admirable, they return answers
like these:—</p>

<p>“‘We certainly should embrace it, were it not for
the world and our means of living. The world would
hate, despise, insult us. And even from your own
Christian people we should meet with ridicule and
contempt. And how can you refuse the demands of
nature? You missionaries cannot support us, nor would
it be fair to require you to do it. Your governors will
make no provision for us. Besides, our ancestors here
constantly professed the same religion which we are
professing.’”</p>

<p>The reference here to the reception a convert would
be likely to receive from the Christian people, by which
they meant the Europeans, reveals the religious
conditions existing in the time of Schwartz. At no
period in the history of Christian missions in India had
the cause of Christ received any considerable approval
from the representatives of the civil power. In the early
days of the Company no impediment was placed in the
way of preaching the glad tidings of Christianity, but
the ruling classes had studiously avoided any interference
with the superstitious and religious customs of the
natives. Meanwhile in the region of the Carnatic these
idolatries were on the decline and we have seen how
readily the message of the missionaries was received, even
by the Brahmins. Probably such a scene as we have
just considered in the preaching of Schwartz has not its
parallel even in modern missions. But when the debate
in the British Parliament raised the religious question<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
on the renewal of the Company’s charter in 1793 quite
another spirit was made manifest. A jealous fear of
weakening our hold on India by disturbing the religious
predilections of the natives became a scare and a
hindrance, which has taken many years to overcome.
The opinion which created this difficulty was very clearly
stated by Mr. Fisher, an English chaplain, to the effect
that “even amongst many of the most enlightened
British officials in the country there could be no
more dangerous means of estranging the hearts of the
people from the Government and no surer way of
endangering the stability of the English rule than by
attempting to meddle with the religious concerns of the
Hindus, however prudently and carefully one might set
to work. All were convinced that rebellion, civil war,
and universal unrest would certainly accompany every
attempt to promote missionary enterprise, and above all
that the conversion of a high caste native soldier would
inevitably mean the disbanding of the army and the
overthrow of British rule in India.” This false position
soon began to bear its natural fruit; if these idolatries
were to be considered and protected it might perhaps be
a paying policy to patronize them. Therefore we read:
“The civil and military servants of the Company were
compelled to present offerings with their own hands to
idols and to fire salutes in their honour; and Christian
Englishmen, whose religious scruples caused them to
shrink from these unhallowed compliances, had no
alternative but to relinquish their appointments.” The
converts had now to contend with a new difficulty which
ought never to have been put in their way by the power
which emanated from the country from which Christianity
came. They not only had to face the separation and
hostility of their former relations and friends but the
English boycotted them, and heathens and Mohammedans
were preferred before them for employment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p>“You do your work by halves,” was the remark of
a Brahmin to Schwartz. “After you have instructed us
you say, ‘Go and labour.’ But what shall we do? If
you could get us situations suited to our abilities, you
would see things wear a different aspect. But you take
us out of all our connections and are not able to place
us in any other.”</p>

<p>“This,” adds Schwartz, “is an appeal which bears
with too much force on us unfriended missionaries. Yes;
we are constrained to admit that if any one confesses the
Christian doctrine he is despised, not only by his own
connections but by Europeans also. This is a hard
trial.”</p>

<p class="ph3">A NOBLE DEFENCE OF MISSIONS.</p>


<p>When the renewal of the Charter of the East India
Company was under discussion in the House of Commons,
Wilberforce, the champion of liberty and progress,
proposed that the religious and social improvement of the
Indian people should be an accepted obligation. This
was fiercely opposed, especially by a Mr. Montgomery
Campbell, who had for a time held some official position
in Madras. He scouted any possibility of the conversion
of a Hindu, sneered at the attempt as visionary, and,
while appreciating the high character of Schwartz, did
not hesitate to depreciate the permanent value of his
work. When the report of this attack reached him at
Tanjore, Schwartz lost no time in sending to the Society
for Promoting Christian Knowledge a powerful reply, a
noble vindication of missions in general and his work in
particular. The old veteran was roused with indignation
and yet the spirit of his masterly defence of his Hindu
converts is in every way becoming a Christian. As Dr.
Buchanan rightly describes his letter, “Perhaps no
Christian defence has appeared in these latter ages more
characteristic of the Apostolic simplicity and primitive
energy of truth than this apology of the venerable
Schwartz.”</p>

<p>The first intimation which reached him of this violent
attack upon missionary effort in India was from a
newspaper cutting in which Mr. Montgomery Campbell
had sought to justify his vote against the proposition of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
Mr. Wilberforce. The arguments adduced were not
unlike those put forward by objectors to foreign
missions to-day, declaring that only the lowest class were
proselytized and that they degraded the religion which
ignorantly they came to profess.</p>

<p>“Mr. Schwartz, whose character was held so
deservedly high,” said he, “could not have any reason
to boast of the purity of his followers: they were
proverbial for their profligacy. An incident occurred to
his recollection perfectly in point. He had been
preaching many hours to this caste of proselytes on the
heinousness of theft and in the heat of his discourse had
taken off his stock, when that and his gold buckle was
stolen by one of his virtuous and enlightened
congregation. In such a description of native did the
doctrine of the missionaries operate. Men of high caste
would spurn the idea of changing the religion of their
ancestors.”</p>

<p>To this specific charge Schwartz had a clear denial to
give. On the occasion referred to, he was visiting some
villages whose inhabitants were infamous thieves, and it
is true that when he took off his stock some thievish boys
did take it away. But neither that nor the buckle was
stolen by Christians, they were pure heathen, and even
they restored the property and handed over the boys for
punishment.</p>

<p>“Neither did I preach,” rejoined Schwartz, “at that
time. Mr. Campbell says I preached for two hours. I
did not so much as converse with any man. This poor
story, totally misrepresented, is alleged by Mr. M.
Campbell to prove the profligacy of Christians, whom he
called with a sneer, ‘<i>virtuous and enlightened people</i>.’
If he has no better proof, his conclusion is built upon
a bad foundation and I shall not admire his logic; truth
is against him.</p>

<p>“Neither is it true that the best part of those people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
are Pariahs. Had Mr. M. Campbell visited, even once,
our Church he would have observed that <i>more than two-thirds
were of high caste</i>, and so it is at Tranquebar and
Vepery.”</p>

<p>He then goes on to prove how unfounded is the
assertion that “a missionary is a disgrace to any
country.” Speaking not of himself alone but also of his
fellow-worker, Mr. Jaenické, he shows how in times of
difficulty the Government have been only too thankful
to enlist their services. On one occasion one of the richest
inhabitants said to him, “Sir, if you send a person to
us, send one who has heard all your ten commandments,”
and another time a Rajah said to one of the leading men
of the British Government: “<i>We all, you and I, have
lost our credit, let us try whether the inhabitants will
trust Mr. Schwartz.</i>” And they did so. In fact, if the
Christians at all risks had not stood loyal at such a
crisis the Fort could not have resisted the attack. It was
not the poor native Christians who were living profligate
lives, but the Gentoo dubashes who were lending money
at exorbitant interest and were allowed to collect the
same without any supervision.</p>

<p>“When Sir Archibald Campbell was Governor and Mr.
M. Campbell his private secretary, the inhabitants of
Tanjore were so miserably oppressed by the manager and
the Madras dubashes that they quitted the country. Of
course, all cultivation ceased. In the month of June it
should commence, but nothing was done even at the
beginning of September. Every one dreaded the calamity
of a famine. I entreated the Rajah to remove that
shameful oppression and to recall the inhabitants. He
sent them word that justice should be done to them; but
they disbelieved his promises. He then desired <i>me</i> to
write to them and to assure them that he, at my intercession,
would show kindness to them. I did so. All
immediately returned, and first of all the Kallar (or as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
they are commonly called collaries) believed my
word, so that seven thousand men came back in one day.
The other inhabitants followed their example. When I
exhorted them to exert themselves to the utmost because
the time for cultivation was almost lost, they replied in
the following manner: ‘<i>As you have shown kindness to
us, you shall not have reason to repent of it; we intend to
work night and day to show our regard for you.</i>’ Sir
Archibald Campbell was happy when he heard of it, and
we had the satisfaction of having a better crop than the
preceding year.”</p>

<p>The closing words written by Schwartz on this defence
of Christian missions deserve a permanent record; they
are as applicable now as they were then, and sum up
the whole case for preaching Christianity to the heathen.</p>

<p>“Now I am well aware,” he goes on to say, “that
some will accuse me of having boasted. I confess the
charge willingly but lay the blame upon those who have
constrained me to commit that folly. I might have
enlarged my account, but, fearing that some characters
would have suffered by it, I stop here. One thing,
however, I affirm before God and man, <i>that if Christianity
in its plain and undisguised form were properly promoted,
the country would not suffer but be benefited by it</i>.</p>

<p>“If Christians were employed in some important
offices, they should, if they misbehaved, be doubly
punished, but to reject them entirely is not right and
discourageth.</p>

<p>“The glorious God and our blessed Redeemer commanded
His Apostles to preach the Gospel to all nations.
The knowledge of God, of His divine perfections, and
of His mercy to mankind, may be abused; but there is
no other method of reclaiming men than by instructing
them well. To hope that the heathen will lead a good
life without the knowledge of God is a chimera.</p>

<p>“The praise bestowed on the heathens of this country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
by many of our historians is reflected by a close (I
might almost say a superficial) inspection of their lives.
Many historical works are more like a romance than
history. Many gentlemen here are astonished how some
historians have prostituted their talents by writing fables.</p>

<p>“I am now on the brink of eternity; but to this
moment I declare that I do not repent of having spent
forty-three years here in the service of my Divine
Master. Who knows but God may remove some of the
great obstacles to the propagation of the Gospel. Should
a reformation take place among the Europeans, it would
no doubt be the greatest blessing to the country.”</p>

<p>It is only just and right to record that, after perusing
this complete and touching disclaimer by Schwartz, the
critic of missions tendered an immediate apology to
him. But the mischief would not by this be undone.
The “Madras Courier” of the 24th May, 1793, made
sympathetic comments on the attack. Schwartz in his
reply had completely disposed of the charge, yet this
journal continued to repeat that all native Christians
were of the lowest class, and the European officials and
the Brahmins began, with an easily satisfied conviction,
to make it hard for the Christian convert to live. In
1802 the Hindu Maravars of Tinnevelly, judging that, after
what Mr. Montgomery Campbell had said, the Christians
might be molested with impunity, so bitterly persecuted
them that the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge
had to appeal to the Directors of the East India Company
to put a stop to this oppression, which was successful.
The incident has the old moral that an unjust charge
may be fully disproved but a vindication can never follow
or kill the slander.</p>

<p>Throughout the year 1794 many letters full of
fatherly advice were written by Schwartz from Tanjore
to his young ward Serfogee at Madras. He counsels
him to look to nothing less than the Almighty power of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
God as a sufficient help in the perilous paths of his youth.
“Your welfare, believe me,” he writes, “depends entirely
upon God who governs all things. If He is your God
and Father all will be well. But that He may be your
protector and benefactor, you must honour, adore and
fear Him. If you refuse to acknowledge Him, it is but
just if He forsakes you. You have read the declaration
of God concerning Israel, ‘O that they would fear me
and keep my commandments, it should be well with
them.’ But Israel disobeyed often and they were severely
punished. It is therefore left to your choice, whether
you will honour the true God or the idols. May God
direct us to choose Him for our God and supreme good!”</p>

<p>Again we find him urging this young Oriental, who
may have had some natural inclination to take things
easy, to study more persistently. Some of his considerations
are by no means strange or unnecessary even to
readers who have long since passed the primrose age of
youth.</p>

<p>“A language cannot,” he assures Serfogee, “be
learned but by assiduous application. As the Malabar
boy is now with you, let him not be idle, as he is
inclined to be. He used to make excuses but do not allow
him to stay away; when the new Governor comes he will
wonder that you have made no greater progress in the
English language. I wish you had somebody near you
with whom you could talk. By conversation we improve.
When you send me a letter I wish to see your composition
without being corrected, when I shall be fully convinced
of your progress....</p>

<p>“As Colonel Craithwaite has given you a globe you
ought to learn something of geography, as you live in
the world which God has created, that you may get some
idea of the great God, the Creator of heaven and earth.
It is ignorance of the works of God that inclines us to
value the creatures more than God. A good prince is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
obliged to imitate God. And how can he imitate Him if
he does not know of His goodness, wisdom, power, and
justice?</p>

<p>“I am very glad that you improve in knowledge,
wishing that all useful knowledge may have a proper
effect on your heart. Our knowledge is like a light, in
which we are to walk, so that we are led and influenced
by the knowledge of what is good and just. I have just
examined the children who are in the Tamil School, fifty
in number. All received a new cloth which they put on
with joy. When I am dead, you will I hope clothe
them. But when we look upon the Author of all
blessings, we must humbly acknowledge that it is God
who feedeth and clothes us all....</p>

<p>“Our pride is at the foundation of all our sins. True
humility is the root from which grows every virtue.
There is not an unhappy man on earth but he owes his
misery to his pride. Pride hinders us from hearkening
to the good advice which our friends offer us. Pride
makes us deaf, but true humility enables us to make the
best use of friendly instructions. Our pride makes us
indolent so that we are loth to exert ourselves. We grow
angry with those who intend to stir us up, as a sleeper
becomes angry with the man who awakes him.”</p>

<p>It was always in the mind of Schwartz that this young
man would one day sit on the throne of Tanjore and that
in that position he must exercise the gifts of a ruler and
show discretion and courage in dealing with others.
Serfogee had no doubt some excellent qualities and his
training while at Madras in the care of Mr. Jaenické was a
good preparation for his future responsibilities.</p>

<p>Here is a needful hint from his venerable guardian
on the subject of keeping his own counsel.</p>

<p>“Here in Tanjore,” writes Schwartz, “everything
that is said or written in the palace is known in a short
time throughout the city. Learn from your youth to keep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
your secrets within your own breast. It is related by
Alexander that he told a secret to his friend, enjoining
him to secrecy. This friend, unable to keep this secret,
divulged it. Alexander hearing of it was very wroth,
called for his teacher, and asked what punishment he
ought to inflict on the man who had revealed his secret.
The teacher said: ‘Do not punish him; rather punish
yourself, for if you could not keep your own secret, much
less will others keep it.’”</p>

<p>All these counsels disclose a fatherly spirit and yet
Schwartz was never married. With his affectionate
disposition and his love of children, no man seemed better
qualified for the quiet joys of family and domestic life.
And his letters to his married friends, sometimes pointing
out a mother’s duties to her children and also the love of
a husband and father, disclose, if only between the lines,
a wistful and lingering appreciation for the sacred
blessings of the home circle. But his chief objection was
to young inexperienced missionaries coming out with
their wives, and thereby hindering, in his opinion, their
proper preparation for the work, especially when everything
has to be learnt. His views may seem narrow and
old fashioned and at variance with the experience of
modern methods, but his ideas on the subject are worth
quoting. On receipt of an intimation from the Secretary
of the Society that one of the missionaries on their way
would be accompanied by his wife, this was the reply of
Schwartz:</p>

<p>“I confess, dear sir, I was grieved at it. I assure
you that I honour the state of matrimony as a divinely
instituted state, but if a new missionary comes out he
ought to be unembarrassed. His first work, besides his
attention to his personal religion, is the learning some
languages, which require great attention and unwearied
application. I will not say that a married man is unable
to learn languages, but this I know from experience in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
others, that the work goes on slowly. Besides, a new
missionary who comes out in the married state wants
many things to maintain his family decently which may
distract him. If one should enter into that state after
he had become qualified for his office the difficulty would
be less; but even then, he ought to be well assured of
the real piety of his wife, otherwise she will be a sore
impediment to him in the discharge of his duty.”</p>

<p>These were not the words of a gaunt or fanatical
ascetic, but the deliberate opinion of a genial, large-hearted,
human personality who, while living simply and
single for conscience’ sake, was not condemning matrimony
in a wholesale fashion as regards others in a
like service as himself for the highest welfare of man.
Unlike Martyn he does not appear to have suffered the
pang of a refusal. Schwartz quite conscientiously and
sincerely followed the Apostolic injunction of St. Paul,
ever his highest ideal of the Christian missionary, when
he tells the Corinthian Church that, “He that is
unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord,
how he may please the Lord, but he that is married
careth for the things that are of the world, how he
may please his wife.” It is recorded that on one occasion
a ship arrived from Germany with a lady on board
consigned to him as a prospective wife, either due to the
unsolicited sympathy or unappreciated humour of a
friend. At any rate she was promptly returned with a
letter of indignant remonstrance from Schwartz. We
may at any rate say of this man that he served God first
with a single and undivided devotion; he made sacrifices
but he was abundantly rewarded.</p>

<p>One of the difficulties which always menaced the
success and progress of the Danish missionaries was the
active opposition of the Roman Catholic priests. The
persecution of one section of Christians by another
section, each repudiating with some heat the other’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
doctrines as heretical, was not a very edifying spectacle
in the eyes of the Hindus. The state of the Romish
missions after the death of Xavier was described by the
Abbé Dubois, writing in December, 1875, after thirty-two
years’ experience in Mysore. Not only were the converts
diminished but in moral and religious tone the work was
degenerate. He gives the unvarnished truth, which may
seem almost desperately pessimistic in its conclusions,
and this is the Romanism which the Protestant missions
had to reckon with. Speaking then of his own converts
the Abbé declares: “By far the greater part of them—in
fact I might say the whole—present nothing but an empty
shadow, a hollow mockery of Christianity; for in the long
period of twenty-five years during which I learnt to know
them most intimately and lived amongst them as their
spiritual director, I can’t say that I once found anywhere
one single downright and straightforward Christian
amongst the natives of India. Several of them are fairly
well instructed and know what are the duties of a
Christian; but far and away the larger part of them live in
the crassest ignorance and their entire religion is confined
to the observance of a few external ordinances and the
repetition of certain forms of prayer, without possessing
one single spark of the inward practical spirit of
Christianity. The Sabbath is either but just remembered
or wholly disregarded and all their religious exercises are
performed either simply because of custom or a vain
desire to please men rather than God.”</p>

<p>There could hardly be a more complete confession of
failure than the conviction which the Abbé Dubois
expresses when he declares, after a long personal experience,
that Roman Catholic missions have borne no
fruit worth speaking of in India. Christianity, he says,
is wholly discredited.</p>

<p>“This religion which formerly was an object of
indifference or contempt has now, as I can testify from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
personal observation, well nigh become an object of
abhorrence; it is certain that for sixty years past not
one single proselyte has been made. Before half a
century has elapsed there will not be the slightest trace
of this Christianity remaining among the Hindus. I
must confess it with shame and humiliation that there
was not a single member of them (the Christian in his
own sphere of labour) of whom it could be said, that he
had accepted Christianity, save for some objectionable
secondary consideration.”</p>

<p>It cannot be said, happily, that this dismal prophecy
even as regards his own Church has been fulfilled but
the statement is sufficient evidence of the condition of
the Romanist Missions when Abbé Dubois based his
pessimistic conclusions.</p>

<p>The correspondence of Schwartz has many references to
his contact with the Roman Catholics, and while they
made themselves very offensive to his work, it was easy
to see that he was doing the best to live at peace with
them and not to provoke unnecessarily any spirit of
hostility. This however was no easy matter. In his
journal under date the 18th October, 1770, we find a
record of an attempt on his part to come to a friendly
understanding with the priest.</p>

<p>“The 18th October was the day appointed for the
public conference which the Romish Padre was to hold
with me. I went, accompanied by two helpers, after
previous prayer to God. The rules by which we were
both to bind ourselves were these: (1) To do everything
in love and without heat; (2) To make the Word of God
alone the judge in the dispute; (3) To allow all that
should be advanced on either side to be taken down by a
capable scribe, so that at the expiration of the conference,
the whole might be reviewed. These three rules were
proposed by me; and the members of the Romish
congregation had nothing to urge in objection, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
whether the Romish Padre would be satisfied with them,
they could not decide. At eight o’clock in the morning
we arrived. Many of the Romish persuasion were
assembled. They received me, but not with much
courtesy. At length they collected together opposite the
church, where I expounded to the members present many
beautiful passages, as Matt. v. 1-10; John xiv. 6; 2
Cor. iv. 1; 1 Tim. i. 4-6; Matt. ii. 28. One of their
chief persons said, ‘You speak as if one need never sin
any more.’ At length, at eleven o’clock, a messenger
arrived from the Romish Padre, with a message that he
would not come, for he did not consider it to be necessary.
The Romish were somewhat moved at his having broken
his word on the subject, after having promised them that
he would appear without fail.</p>

<p>“I again enforced the truth on their hearts, implored
them to trust in the Word of God and become obedient
to it and so took leave of them. One of the helpers
remained behind with them, an old friend having requested
him to eat something with him, when he re-presented much
to them out of God’s Word.”</p>

<p>A year afterwards we get another entry in the journal
describing in simple terms an act of persecution, which
will represent the spirit of intolerance on the part of the
Roman Catholics. Schwartz had been gathering his
helpers together to comfort and encourage them amid
these persecutions to declare the truth without shrinking,
but “not to use the weapons of the enemy but much
more after the example of the Lord Christ and His
Apostles to oppose to gainsayers humility and meekness.”
An opportunity for displaying this virtue soon presented
itself: “It happened that a near relative of one of the
helpers, whose name is Nyanapragasam, arrived here from
the country and soon experienced a fatal attack of
smallpox. He solicited the helper and his mother to
nurse him in his sickness, which they willingly did. The
sick man was a Papist but very ignorant, on which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
account the helper, besides nursing his body, often read
to him from the Word of God and particularly exhorted
him to turn with all his sins to the Mediator and Surety
of the human family. The sick man expressed himself
much satisfied and gratefully accepted the instruction.
In about five days he died.</p>

<p>“During the illness none of the Roman Catholics had
inquired after him, but as soon as he was dead they
came to bury him. The helper said nothing against it,
but as a near relative desired leave to follow the corpse.
Some of the Romish said, ‘You shall not join the funeral
procession because you are a heretic.’ The helper said,
‘When your Catechist comes I will ask him, and if he
be against it I will go away.’ The Romish Catechist
arrived and the helper inquired whether he might not
be permitted to follow the corpse of his near relative?
‘What,’ answered the former, ‘do you take so great a
liberty as to go with us?’ He drew his slipper from his
foot and beat the helper, on which about twenty Papists
assaulted him and beat him so long that he swooned.
Then they dragged him by the hair through the streets
and left him prostrate in the house of a heathen.</p>

<p>“This occurred on Sunday as early as seven o’clock
and at some distance from my house. When I had
finished public worship with the Tamils about ten o’clock
the circumstance was communicated to me. From ten to
twelve o’clock I preached to the English, after which I
went with an English physician to the poor and almost
murdered helper. When we arrived he was unable to
speak or move. After losing blood, however, his chest,
where he had received most injury, again heaved. When
the case was made known to the Commanding Officer, he
caused the Romish Catechist and three others, who had
been particularly active in this murderous occurrence, to
be imprisoned. The Nabob’s son put them into his own
prison and promised to examine into the affair.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span></p>

<p>The end of the case was quite on Oriental lines. The
Nabob made a brave show of justice, ordering his chief
servants to hear both sides. “When he observed, however,
that the ill-treated helper was entirely innocent, and that
on the other side there were presents offered, it was said
that he would defer it for the present, and this he
continued to promise until we became weary of his
promising and he unmindful of its fulfilment.”</p>

<p>Schwartz was pressed to carry the thing further but
he said if these cruel men had been publicly punished
they would be considered by their friends as martyrs. He
begged them to be patient and endure.</p>

<p>“Whosoever will follow after the Lord Christ must
take up his cross. When something of this has shown
itself, will you be the first to yield? Be comforted, it
will all turn out better, even in the way of the Cross,
than you think. And having confirmed ourselves with
many beautiful texts and examples, we went out
comforted and again preached repentance towards God
and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.... The helper
who had been ill-treated by the Romish conducted himself
excellently, prayed fervently, and as soon as he was cured
went forth again and preached the Word of God in the
cities and villages.”</p>

<p>On another occasion he was fortunate enough to get a
personal interview with a Romish Padre and in their
discussion Schwartz strongly points out his objections to
the idolatries of the Church of Rome.</p>

<p>“If you prostrate yourselves,” he asks, “before an
image, complain to it of your affliction and desire help, do
you not honour it after the idolatrous manner? God
says in the second commandment, ‘Thou shalt not make
any graven image—thou shalt not bow down to it or
worship it.’ The Papist says, ‘Thou shalt’—See how
Popery opposes itself to God.” “The Papist,” said the
Padre, “is the follower of St. Peter.” “I heartily wish,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
replied Schwartz, “that it were so. Follow Peter and
we from our hearts will rejoice. Peter was humble and
desired no worship when he was in the house of Cornelius.
Your new Roman Peter will be worshipped. Examine
into it again my worthy Padre and follow after God and
His word.”</p>

<p>From this point the conversation proceeded to what he
calls the idolatry of the Mass and the refusal of the
sacramental cup to the laity, which were but feebly
defended by the Romish Padre, to whom in conclusion
he addressed this brief but solemn warning: “My dear
Padre, prove all things by the Word of God. You and
I shall soon appear before the Judgment seat of Christ,
when we shall have to render an account of our ministry
and doctrine and the souls which we have neglected.”</p>

<p>“He departed wishing that I might become a Saint
and I wished him sincerity of heart.”</p>

<p class="ph3">THE SHADOWS LENGTHEN.</p>


<p>Although Schwartz was still bravely going on with his
work it became evident that he was failing fast. But
he realized all the more how much must be done to
complete the work he had in hand. This guardianship of
Serfogee was on his mind constantly. During this period
of the stay of the young man in Madras, the question
of the validity of Ameer Sing’s title to the throne of
Tanjore was being raised by the widows of the late Rajah,
and in doing this they had the invaluable assistance of
Schwartz. The authorities there were at great pains to
test the value of the opinion of the Hindu pundits who
had been bribed to favour the claims of Ameer Sing to
his present position. Lord Cornwallis was implored to
settle this difficult question of the succession before
leaving India, because, these widows pointed out, it would
not be difficult for Ameer Sing, though at that time
without any heir, to adopt some child and thus place
another obstruction in the way of Serfogee’s lawful claim.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the anarchy and misery which increased
in the unhappy kingdom of Tanjore through the
incapacity and profligacy of Ameer Sing and his satellites
made the position intolerable, and at last, after some
delay, the Court of Directors passed a minute under the
presidency of Lord Teignmouth, the new Governor-General,
which practically settled the title of Serfogee as
the future and only ruler of the place. The president
therein expressed his entire disbelief in the pretensions of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
the reigning Rajah and then proceeded to give his
judgment upon the important and reliable interposition
of Schwartz upon this delicate and complicated question.
This eulogium of a venerable missionary in a purely
official document deserves preservation; certainly in
modern times such a testimony is rarely if ever adduced.
These are the words of Lord Teignmouth:</p>

<p>“With regard to Mr. Schwartz, whose name the president
has never heard mentioned without respect, and
who is as distinguished for the sanctity of his manners
as for his ardent zeal in the promulgation of his religion;
whose years, without impairing his understanding, have
added weight to his character, and whose situation has
enabled him to be the protector of the oppressed and the
comforter of the afflicted, who, as a preacher of the
Christian faith and a man without influence except from
character, was held in such estimation by the late Rajah,
a Hindu prince approaching to his dissolution, that he
thought him the fittest person he could consult concerning
the management of his country, during the minority of
his adopted son, Serfogee; and who, displaying more
integrity than foresight, in the advice he gave, did
certainly not prove the enemy of Ameer Sing, since at
his suggestion he was named Regent—to the solemn
assurance of such a man, the president is compelled to
declare his unqualified assent, and upon his information
he can easily reconcile the difference between the personal
declarations and the letters of the Rajah.”</p>

<p>In the end the Directors reversed the action of Sir
Archibald Campbell which, however, they declared, “was
formed from the best and most upright intentions,” and
Lord Hobart expressed at the Madras Council his entire
concurrence in favour of Serfogee, and in due course he
was elevated to his rightful position, although not in full
possession of his rights until his aged friend and faithful
protector had passed away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span></p>

<p>Bearing bravely his weight of years and some
infirmities, Schwartz still pursued his labours of love,
encouraging the young converts, warning the unruly and
headstrong, tenderly seeking the welfare of the children,
and doing his utmost to establish on a sound basis the
Church in its sacred offices and work. While diligent in
preaching the simple truths of Christianity to the poor
and the outcastes, Schwartz proved himself a skilled
debater in holding controversy on religious topics with
the learned Brahmins. They on their part were perfectly
frank with him and respected his willingness to hear any
objections they thought well to urge against Christianity.
Their attitude may well be expressed in their own words:</p>

<p>“Very true,” they said, “your doctrine, your
religion, your instruction is a pleasing thing, but it is
inconsistent with flesh and blood, it is repugnant to our
carnal affections, it strikes at the natural propensity to
moral evil and to worldly pleasures. Moreover, we do
not see your Christian people live conformably to what
they teach. The Christians appear to be doing quite the
contrary; they curse, they sneer, they get drunk, they
steal, they cheat, and deal false with one another, nay,
they blaspheme upon matters of religion and often make
a mock of those who profess to be religious. In short,
you Christians demean yourselves as badly, if not worse,
than we heathens. Now pray, of what benefit and
advantage is all your instruction and recommendation of
Christ’s religion, if it does not reform the lives of your
own people? Should you not first endeavour to convert
your Christians ere you attempt to proselytize us
pagans?”</p>

<p>It is not difficult to call up the scene, the cluster of
twenty-four grave Brahmins, watching with keen eyes
to see what Schwartz would or could say in answer to
all this. Then the white-haired man, perfect in his
mastery not only of their tongue but of their literature,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
would in clear persuasive tones point out to them the
truth as it is in Jesus. By a sudden consent of feeling
they all draw nearer and when he has done speaking, they
thank him for his words. “Of a truth,” they exclaim,
“you are a holy man, and if all you Christians thought
and spoke and lived as you do, we would without delay
undergo the change and become Christians also.”</p>

<p>In the midst of this continuous and absorbing work,
Schwartz was not unmindful of his own spiritual needs.
Happily he was constitutionally free from that introspective
self-condemnation which made so melancholy the
experience of others in his day. Probably his theological
standpoint was very much the same as that of Henry
Martyn, but Schwartz was less of a mystic than he and
possessed a calm and restfulness of spirit which his great
successor in the field did not always enjoy. But no man
knew better the value of that intimate and Divine
communion which we know as “the practice of the
presence of God.” In the simplicity of his faith there
was peace, not arising from any self-complacency, but
because his soul, hungering and thirsting after
righteousness, was so abundantly filled. This is his
meditation on the joy which a Christian should enjoy and
its Divine source: “This true union and communion
with Jesus is the source of joy—the only source. From
hence will follow a willingness to love, serve, and obey,
and glorify Him as long as we live. Is it possible that
we, who have found pardon, peace, and a lively hope of
a glorious eternity in Jesus; that we, who have been made
happy in Him, should not wish and endeavour to live to
His glory?</p>

<p>“But if instead of trusting in Jesus and His consummate
atonement, we trust and rely on our own virtue
and consequently stand upon our own foundation, we
shall never enjoy a moment’s peace and unshaken delight.
Our virtue and holiness are and must remain imperfect.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
We shall therefore always have reason to confess before
God: ‘If Thou wilt mark in my thoughts, designs,
intentions, what is amiss, who shall stand before Thee?’
Let us therefore seek for pardon, peace, and joy in Jesus;
and having found that let us be grateful and obedient.
But though we should be as holy as any of the apostles,
let us beware lest we put our confidence in anything but
the sufferings and atoning death of Jesus Christ.”</p>

<p>With all this he was ever awake to the practical side
of religion, and in offering advice to others would constantly
draw upon his own personal experience to
illustrate and enforce the truths he fain would teach.
His views, for instance, about what is good for those who
are workers in the vineyard of grace will never grow
old or out of date.</p>

<p>“A missionary,” he writes, “must guard against
being cast down and dissatisfied, for this, especially here,
is a poison to the body and highly pernicious to the soul,
because thereby faith, love, and hope decrease, nay
absolutely perish, and when the people remark that such
an one is discontented, it is an impediment to the way of
his labouring on their souls; from which nevertheless our
comfort ought to arise. Whenever I meet with anything
disagreeable <i>I go and catechize for an hour</i>. This
employment sweets even bitter to me. No missionary
must give way to complaining. <i>We must be witnesses for
our Lord and not converters merely.</i> One could wish
indeed that, as three thousand souls were converted by
Peter’s sermon, a visible abundant blessing might rest
on our labours. Meanwhile sowing has its season, and
reaping has its season, and, moreover, it might still be a
question whether, with such great success, we should hold
fast humility of heart. The best way is to labour
diligently and then to pray that God would bless our
labour.”</p>

<p>He had many disappointments, as all who seek the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
welfare of others are bound to have, but he cherished with
thankfulness the souls of those who had been given him.
And not only amongst the heathen. As chaplain of the
English troops he found a thrilling pleasure in gathering
together little groups of soldiers and instructing them in
the knowledge of God and His righteousness. He knew
that a soldier’s life is such a test of character, that
anything less than faithfulness and consistency would
never be tolerated in the barrack room. A man who
wears the King’s uniform must either be a Christian in
deed or a Christian not at all. This was true then, as it
is to-day. We get some very interesting glimpses of work
in the ranks and of brave good men who fought a good
fight in more senses than one in those days long ago.</p>

<p>On his seventieth birthday, Schwartz, in marking the
date, 8th October, 1796, is full of rejoicing that for so long
his life has been spared and that goodness and mercy
have indeed followed him thus far. He looks back to
the time when the call first came to him and how through
a thicket of many trials and difficulties he was brought
safely by the providence of Almighty God. We catch
his song of praise in the lines of a letter written just
about this time.</p>

<p>“Ebenezer! Hitherto the Lord hath helped me.
To-day I entered upon my seventy-first year. O the
richness of His grace, compassions, and forbearance,
which I have experienced during seventy years! Praise,
honour, and adoration are due to a gracious God, Father,
Lord and Holy Ghost for the numerous proofs of His
abounding grace. Who am I, poor, wretched sinner,
that Thou hast led me till now! O, my God, forsake
me not in my old age but let me record, for the
encouragement of others, the mercy which has spared,
pardoned, and comforted me, and may they be induced
to put their trust in Thee!</p>

<p>“I am still able to go through the labour of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
instructing both young and old, without being
over fatigued. This duty is so great a refreshment
to me that I heartily praise God for continued health and
strength to declare to heathens and Christians His name
who has sent Christ as a Saviour and made Him, ‘our
wisdom and righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.’
Let worldlings boast as much as they please, my boast
is in the Lord, from Whom alone cometh my salvation.”</p>

<p>It was with Schwartz a growing conviction that the
hope of the work lay in the children, and he made it
his business to examine them in the schools from time
to time to see that they were being properly grounded
in the faith. His advancing years and increasing weakness
did not hinder him in this duty, and we find him
again and again in his journal and letters referring to
the happy times he spent with the young people of his
flock. Writing to his friend, Dr. Schultze, he says:</p>

<p>“I have just risen from an examination of the school
children, after having previously finished catechizing.
Such examinations we have once a month, and it is in
many respects an advantage to have them frequently, but
particularly because the schoolmaster is thus encouraged
to fulfil his duty faithfully. We examine their reading,
writing, and arithmetic, and hear them repeat by heart
the principal texts and a hymn.”</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that Schwartz had ever before
him the future of these children, and the possibility of
these being one day catechists and schoolmasters who
would be entrusted with the guidance of other minds. In
this and in other directions we recognize how far-seeing
was his policy, and that with the limited means at his
disposal, so different from the resources of to-day, he did
useful work in education and training. He tells us his
plan in one of his letters:</p>

<p>“I have selected from the school ten lively boys,
whom I daily instruct in the doctrines of Christianity and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
Church history, as well as the method of explaining the
principal passages of Scripture. I allow them each a
small sum monthly to prevent the necessity of their
applying to other labour for support. Not that we expect
that every one of them will be fit to be employed in
Church offices, but they are thus previously instructed
and their abilities as well as conduct are in the way of
being proved. Those of whom we entertain hopes of
usefulness we send with the catechists into the country,
in order to afford them some assistance. May God endue
them with His Spirit, sanctify their hearts, and make
them useful to the benefit of the congregation and the
glory of His name.”</p>

<p>His thoughts again turn to the brevity of life, and
he naturally questions himself as to how much longer he
will be able to go on with the work he loves. These
young souls in his care, whom he is trying to nurture
as a wise and tender shepherd, will they remain faithful?
He listens to the noise of war and strife, and prays for
the time when peace shall come to India and Christianity
will have many loyal witnesses, and the people will depart
from darkness and see the light of life.</p>

<p>“How much longer,” he writes, “God may permit
me to occupy my station is known to Him alone. My
times are in His hands. He has heard my unworthy
prayer that I may not become quite useless in old age....
A few months ago I seemed standing on the
banks of eternity, being suddenly seized with a painful
oppression on my chest. I consider it as a summons from
my Lord to hold myself in readiness at whatsoever hour
He may come.... I look upon this sudden illness
as a kind monitor to teach me that my gracious Lord will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
soon call me away. May I be able to say, ‘Come, Lord
Jesus!’ You see then that I shall soon quit this world.
A blessed eternity is now the daily subject of my
meditations. How awful is this change! Blessed be God
Who hath sent us a Redeemer, who has borne our sins
and purchased eternal happiness for all who, being
sensible of their sins, ‘flee to Him for refuge.’ If we
are reconciled to God by that blessed Redeemer we have
no reason to be afraid of dying and quitting this world.
Our whole life ought to be a preparation for death. May
God give us grace to die to sin and the evil of the world,
and to live to His glory, that when He calls us away, we
may be prepared for that great change! To look up to
the glorious state of the blessed in heaven is, and will
be, a strong preservative of a true Christian.”</p>

<p>Such thoughts as these are common to people,
especially the old, as they look heavenward.</p>

<p>When Henry Martyn was travelling in India in 1811,
a Captain Kinsey, who had been brought up by Schwartz,
told him: “It is said that Schwartz had a warning given
him of his death. One clear moonlight night he saw
a light and heard a voice which said to him, ‘Follow
me.’ He got up and went to the door, here the vision
vanished. The next day he sent for Dr. Anderson, and
said, ‘An old tree must fall.’ On the doctor’s perceiving
that there was nothing the matter with him, Schwartz
asked him whether he perceived any disorder in his
intellect, to which the doctor replied, ‘No.’ He and
General Floyd (now in Ireland), another friend of
Schwartz, came and stayed with him. The next fifteen
days he was continually engaged in devotion and attended
no more to the school; on the last day he died in his
chair.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span></p>

<p>He wrote his last letter to the Secretary of the Society
for Promoting Christian Knowledge on the 4th September,
1797, in which, with his clear, business-like attention to
details, he speaks of the stores and presents, and gratefully
thanks the good friends in England for all the
generous support they had given to the work, and this
he does for all the brethren who are his comrades and
fellow-workers in the field. God had graciously preserved
their lives and health so that he was still able to go
through his accustomed work, though with less vigour
than heretofore. He added that should his life be prolonged,
he intended to give a full account of the mission
at the end of the year, and concluded with a prayer that
God would prosper the work of their revered superiors.
He evidently looked forward later on to a detailed report
of his stewardship, and the position and future prospects
of the mission. But God disposed otherwise.</p>

<p>A month after dispatching this letter he was taken
ill with hoarseness and a sudden cold, and his old friend,
Dr. Kennedy, hastened to his side and gave him all the
relief possible. But his sickness was very distressing,
and he had to endure much pain. It was a comfort to
him that his colleague, Mr. Kohlhoff, was present during
this indisposition, and on the 4th November, 1797, he
was further cheered by the unexpected arrival of the
Rev. J. D. Jaenické, his beloved helper. Although
greatly weakened and sometimes suffering so much that
he cried once: “If it be the will of the Lord to take
me to Himself, His will be done. May His name be
praised!” He never showed any impatience, and his mind
was at peace. He was able to sit up still, and asked
that the Sunday School children should gather in his
parlour and sing their hymns to him, and then he gave
them a little talk on some Bible subject, and commended
their young hearts and lives to God in a touching prayer.
This was the usual practice every evening, and when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
native children had gone home he called the English boys
and girls to come near to him to read their chapter, and
then join in singing their favourite Watts’ hymns. One
of which he was very fond, and called his beloved hymn,
began with the words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Far from my thoughts, vain world, begone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let my religious hours alone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fain would mine eyes my Saviour see,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I wait a visit, Lord, from Thee.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At other times the natives came in to see their friend,
and with much earnestness and love he begged of them to
forsake all their heathen gods and wickedness, and turn
to God, Who alone could give them peace. They listened
deeply affected, and sometimes they tried to cheer and
interest him by speaking of the latest news in the town
and the wonderful things which were happening. But
the old man said, “The most wonderful thing is that
after hearing so often the doctrines of Christianity and
being convinced of the truth of it, you are notwithstanding
backward to embrace and obey it.”</p>

<p>A distinguished Indian came to see him and inquire
after his health, but the sick man exhorted him also to
renounce his idolatry, beseeching him as he went away to
repent, and bidding him farewell with the words of
solemn warning, “I have often exhorted and warned
you, but you have hitherto disregarded it, you esteem
and honour the creature more than the Creator.” But
among these touching interviews a special interest
attaches to the occasion when Serfogee Rajah came to
visit his old friend. He had arrived at a time when
Schwartz was feeling seriously ill, and the visitor was
brought into the room with the sense that the invalid
was not going to remain long. This greatly upset the
heart of the visitor, who loved Schwartz more than he
loved any living man, for he was indebted to him, not
only for his position on the throne of Tanjore, but for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
many kindnesses and words of wisdom. In broken
language, and very feebly, Schwartz gave what he felt
was his dying charge to the young ruler. His closing
admonition was in these words:</p>

<p>“After God has called me hence, I request you will
be careful not to indulge a fondness for pomp and
grandeur. You are convinced that my endeavours to
serve you have been disinterested. What I now request
you is, that you will be kind to the Christians—if they
behave ill, let them be punished, but if they do well show
yourself to them as their father and protector.</p>

<p>“As the due administration of justice is indispensably
necessary for the prosperity and happiness of every state,
I request you will establish regular courts, and be careful
that impartial justice be administered. I heartily wish
you would renounce your idolatry and serve and honour
the only true God. May He be merciful and enable you
to do it.”</p>

<p>Before Serfogee left his presence he was implored to
make the Bible his guide and friend. He lifted his
hands to heaven, and with great solemnity uttered slowly
these words: “My last and most earnest wish is that
God in His infinite mercy may graciously regard you and
lead your heart and soul to Christ, that I may meet
you again as His true disciple before the throne.”</p>

<p>This last visit and its fatherly and pathetic counsels
would never be forgotten. When December came the
two doctors consulted as to the best remedy, and decided
to give the patient tincture of steel and infusion of bark,
and this had the desired effect. For a time there seemed
signs of improvement, and his friends congratulated one
another on the chance of his recovery. On the first
Sunday in Advent the Sacrament of the Holy Communion
was administered to him to his great profit and
blessing. It was, however, a sorrow to find that while
his more painful symptoms had abated it was only too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
evident that his illness had affected his memory and
enfeebled his mind. Things relating to this world had
become of lessening interest, while eternity became
nearer and more real. One of the favourite books with
Schwartz had been Young’s “Night Thoughts,” and
these poems were a refreshing memory to him now. He
now busied himself with putting in order his papers, and
amongst them was an old letter which awakened afresh
his interest in missions. His comment to his friends was:</p>

<p>“Early this morning I happened to meet with a
letter of my late pious friend—which he addressed to
you in 1788, and which was then forwarded to me. He
says in it, ‘Ought not my son to be a missionary? O,
how ardently do I pray that God will not forsake His
work now that he has opened to our times a wider
field than heretofore! If God cause His Spirit to rest
on both my sons they shall hereafter prove active
labourers in His vineyard.’</p>

<p>“Now, if this son of my deceased friend has natural
gifts and grace—if he have a desire to preach Christ
among the heathen, I beg you to send him out at my
expense. And if I should be called away by the Lord
before his arrival, my brethren will make it good out
of the property I leave. The mission is my heir. Our
hope standeth in the Lord, Who made heaven and
earth. May He be merciful to us and provide His work
to His own glory.... I feel my weakness more and
more—how long the Lord will yet preserve and use me
rests with Him. My times are in His hands. May He
be merciful to me and grant me at last a blessed end.
Amen.”</p>

<p>On the 2nd February, 1798, Mr. Jaenické felt it his
duty to write to the Society for Promoting Christian
Knowledge informing them that his friend and venerable
colleague was now very seriously ill and would never
preach again. The time of his departure was evidently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
drawing near. Looking round upon the faces of the old
friends who one by one were gathering at his bedside,
he smiled saying, “God is good. If we were left
destitute of His help what should we do? We poor
worms of the dust! Our times are in His hands; He
alone can preserve or destroy life. Hitherto He hath
endured our manners with truly paternal tenderness,
hath spared us in the midst of all our sins and provocations,
and crowned us with loving kindness and
tender mercies.” At another time the conversation
turned upon the mercy of God in having called him to
be a missionary, which he said was the most blessed
service in the world. “True,” he added, “a missionary
must bear the cross; but this, my brother, is salutary, the
heart is thereby drawn nearer to God, we are kept
humble; without such trials the self-willed and proud
heart of man would soon exalt itself. The good we
receive at the hand of the Lord far exceeds the evil.
When I consider all the way which God hath hitherto
led me, the distresses from which He hath delivered my
soul, and the riches of His goodness and forbearance and
long suffering, I feel compelled gratefully to exclaim,
‘The Lord be magnified!’ Believe me, it is a privilege
and happiness far beyond all description to enjoy in
Christ the remission of sin. Ah, how much hath my
Saviour done for such a poor sinner as I am! Look at
this poor Christian (he pointed to one sitting at the
gate), how poor he is in the things of this world, whilst
I have every needful supply, and even many a comfort!
What is my superiority over him? Suppose he should
have committed one thousand sins, I am conscious of
having committed ten thousand, and yet my God still bears
with me. And should I ever think myself entitled to
despise a poor man like this?”</p>

<p>Schwartz was the beloved of his people. When
during a temporary improvement in his condition he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
was able slowly to enter his Church once more, which
he had built in his garden, the native Christians received
him with raptures of joy, running up to him, eager to hold
his hand and look into his face again. When Mr. Caemmerer
had to say good-bye in order to resume his work,
Schwartz embraced him with much tenderness. “I will detain
you no longer, my brother,” said he; “set out on your
journey in the name of God, and may He be with you!
As to myself I commit all my concerns to our gracious
God. Whether I live, I live unto the Lord; or whether
I die, I die unto the Lord. Salute the brethren most
cordially. The God of peace be with them. Not knowing
how long it may please God to preserve our lives, let
us be up and doing. Though we should not always be
privileged immediately to see the success of our labours
let us still persevere, so long as God may allow us to
work in His vineyard.”</p>

<p>The disease in his foot, which had been for years a
trouble to him, was causing him great pain, but a native
doctor, in the absence of his English physician, used
some poultice remedies which gave the patient relief.
For this he was very grateful, and gaining a little
strength he was able to say a few parting words to his
friend, Mr. Holtzberg. “Remember me affectionately to
all the brethren and tell them from me never to lose
sight of the <i>main object</i>, and strictly to maintain the
fundamental doctrines of Christianity. I shall now soon
depart to the Lord Jesus. If He will receive me, and forgive
my sins and not enter into judgment with me, but
deal with me according to His tender mercy, all will be
well with me, and I shall praise Him. He might reject
us for our very works’ sake because sin cleaves to them
all.” It was a source of thankfulness to him that in
this last hour of his life he was surrounded by his
beloved brethren, who he said so much comforted his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
spirits. Again and again at his request they sang verses
of his favourite hymns, one of them being,</p>

<p class="center">
“Allein zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ,”<br>
</p>

<p>of which the two closing verses are, in English:</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>His friend, Mr. Jaenické, goes aside to note down some
of his dying instructions, a touching memorandum of an
affectionate and breaking heart.</p>

<p>“When I spoke to him on the subject and expressed
a hope that God might yet restore him to health, he
said, ‘But I should not be able to preach on account of
my teeth.’ I replied, ‘If you only sit here as you do
at present and aid us with your counsel, all things would
go on quite differently from what they would if you
were to leave us.’ But when I next saw him, he said
as soon as I entered, ‘I think the Lord will at last take
me to himself.’ I spoke to him a great deal on the
subject, but he remained silent, settled some pecuniary
matters with me, and gave me some money for Palamcotta.
All this troubled me much. I prayed and wept,
could get no sleep for several nights, and lost my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
appetite and strength, for various thoughts how things
would go on after his departure made me very wakeful.
The physicians say there is no danger as yet, but it now
appears to me that our dear father will soon leave us.
O, if God would graciously strengthen him and spare
him to us yet a little while! If he depart to his rest
what shall we both do?”</p>

<p>He was not to come back, already voices were calling
from the other side of the river. One thought only filled
the sphere of his dying moments, to be with Christ,
which is far better. He wakes up from a brief slumber
with these words on his lips:</p>

<p>“My whole meditation is the death of Jesus, that I
may be like Him. The whole world is a mask. I wish
to be where all is real.”</p>

<p>The English physician is leaning over him and catches
his whisper, “Doctor, in heaven there will be no more
pain.” In a quiet tone he replies, “Very true, but we
must keep you here as long as we can.” There is a
pause, and then the earnest voice speaks again, “O, dear
doctor, let us take care that we may not be missing
there!”</p>

<p>And now they gather round once more, and at his
request they sing, with such voice as they could command
amid their sobs, his favourite hymn:</p>

<p>
“Christus der ist mein Leben.”<br>
</p>

<p>With clasped hands they hear him commending his
soul to God. “O, Lord, hitherto Thou hast preserved
me, hitherto Thou hast brought me, and hast bestowed
innumerable benefits upon me. Do what is pleasing in
Thy sight. I deliver my spirit into Thy hands, cleanse,
and adorn it with the righteousness of my Redeemer, and
receive me into the arms of Thy love and mercy!” A
little group of native servants softly sing a German
hymn, one of Paul Gerhardt’s, the words of which he
had taught them in that language:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span></p>
<p class="center">“O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">O Wounded Head! Must Thou</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Endure such shame and scorn!</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The sunset of a winter afternoon shines on the
windows of the chamber where the watchers stand,
their hands clasped behind them, and their eyes full of
tears. But there is light in the face on the pillow, the
breaking of a day beyond the horizon of time.</p>

<p>Tenderly raised a little in the arms of a friend, he
murmurs a parting blessing, “I wish you many comforts,”
and is gone. On the day following, the 14th
February, 1798, they carried him to his grave in the
garden. Serfogee, crying like a child, hurried to have
one last look at the face of the one who had been more
than father to him, and covers the body with a cloth
of gold. It was intended to sing a hymn as the funeral
made its way, but the lamentations and wailing of the
great crowd of poor natives made this impossible. The
solemn burial service was performed by Mr. Jaenické,
and when this was over and the Europeans had
retired, the natives who filled the sacred building
remained praying and singing hymns. They begged of
the minister to speak of their departed friend, but his
own heart was too full to give any address. To use his
own words, “I could hardly utter even a few words, and
was obliged to summon up all my resolution to read the
service. The servant of the deceased stood near me, and
said, almost as if fainting, ‘Now, he who was the desire
of us all is gone!’ This exclamation went to my heart,
but this is not the language of one but of many, old
and young, great and small, near and afar, Christians
and heathen.”</p>

<p class="ph3">THE MEMORY OF THE JUST.</p>


<p>By his last will and testament Schwartz left all he had
to the mission. He had never married, and had, therefore,
no family obligations to consider, but a hundred
star pagodas, equal to about £43 in English currency
at that time, he directed should be divided amongst his
sister’s children. His two gold watches were to be sold
and the proceeds given to the poor, thirty star pagodas
were to go to his personal servant, and a few silver
articles to his friend, Mr. Kohlhoff, as a token of his
hearty love. But, apart from these trifling specific
bequests, all his savings, together with such property as
he had built with his own money, were devoted to the
maintenance and support of the work he loved so well.
His own personal needs had always been few, his life
almost ascetic in its simplicity, so that he was able to
put by the allowance from the Government as chaplain
to the soldiers, and yet he was generous to the poor,
and always ready to help young catechists in their
studies. As we have seen, he consistently refused to
accept any presents from either European or native
rulers to whom he had been of service, and this in a
time and place when fortunes were easily made and bribes
excused redounds greatly to his credit. A more disinterested
and faithful man never served his God and
country better than he.</p>

<p>Serfogee Rajah took immediate steps towards the
erection of a monument to commemorate the virtues of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
his beloved friend, and, writing to the Society for Promoting
Christian Knowledge, begged them at his
expense to have prepared and send a marble monument
to his memory to be placed in the church, and near the
pulpit where he preached. He closed his request with
the words, “May you, honourable sirs, ever be enabled
to send to this country such missionaries as are like the
late Rev. Mr. Schwartz!” The work was entrusted to
Flaxman, and comprised a beautiful group in bas relief
representing the death-bed scene, where among some
children and friends Serfogee, the Hindu prince, is holding
the hand of his dying friend and receiving his
blessing. The inscription is as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">
To the memory of the<br>
<span class="smcap">Reverend Christian Frederic Schwartz</span>,<br>
born at Sonnenburg of Neumark, in the Kingdom of Prussia,<br>
the 26th October, 1726,<br>
and died at Tanjore, the 13th February, 1798,<br>
in the seventy-second year of his age.<br>
</p>

<p>Devoted from his early manhood to the office of
Missionary in the East, the similarity of his situation to
that of the first preachers of the Gospel produced in him
a similar resemblance to the simple sanctity of the
Apostolic character. His natural vivacity won the affection,
as his unspotted probity and purity of life alike
commanded the reverence, of the Christian, Mohammedan
and Hindu; for Sovereign princes, Hindu and Mohammedan,
selected this humble pastor as the medium of
political negotiation with the British Government, and
the very marble which here records his virtues was
raised by the liberal affection and esteem of the Rajah of
Tanjore, Maha Raja Serfogee.</p>
</div>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b184a.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">SERFOGEE RAJAH’S MONUMENT TO SCHWARTZ</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Still more expressive and touching are the lines which
are inscribed on the granite stone which covers the grave
of Schwartz, written and composed by Serfogee himself,
a curiosity as being the only specimen of English verse
ever attempted by a Hindu prince, at any rate up to that
time. After the inscription of name and date, the
following are the lines of poetry:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Firm wast thou, humble and wise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Honest, pure, free from disguise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Father of orphans, the widow’s support,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Comfort in sorrow of every sort.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To the benighted, dispenser of Light,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Doing, and pointing to that which is right.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">May I, my father, be worthy of thee!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wisheth and prayeth thy Sarabojee.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It ought to be placed on record that this grateful
prince did not only honour his benefactor by an
affectionate epitaph; he showed how much he revered
his memory by building an orphanage and school and
maintaining by his own generosity many poor children,
he also gave every opportunity for his Christian servants
to attend the services of their own Church. He never
forgot his friend. When Dr. Buchanan visited the Rajah
some time afterwards he was led up to where the portrait
of Schwartz hung upon the wall of the palace. “He
then discoursed,” says the visitor, “for a considerable
time concerning ‘that good man,’ whom he ever revered
as his father and guardian.”</p>

<p>Ten years later Bishop Middleton was also on a visit
to Tanjore, and he also records the fact that “his highness
dwelt with evident delight on the blessings which
the heavenly lessons and virtues of Schwartz had shed
upon him and his people,” and a similar expression of
grateful regard occurred on the attendance of Bishop
Heber at a durbar when the Rajah talked warmly about
Schwartz, “his dear father.”</p>

<p>It is a source of regret that this Indian prince, with
all his sincere affection for Schwartz and gratitude for
his kindness to himself personally, should not have become
a Christian. His attachment to the memory of the
venerable missionary, his support and appreciation of the
Christian work among his people after the death of
Schwartz, is certainly much to his credit so long as it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
lasted, when we remember that he lived and died a Hindu
surrounded by his Brahmins who would scarcely regard
his sympathies in the direction of Christianity with any
approval. Still, it is disappointing to record that up to
the time of his sudden death in 1834 he never renounced
his idolatries, and had not apparently received into the
darkness of his heathen head the Light of the world.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact there seems good grounds for
believing that the Rajah had in his later days so far
forgotten the counsels of his venerable friend as to relax
his kindly interest in the work he left behind. There is
a note in Dr. Brown’s “History of Missions,” vol. i.
p. 162, to this effect:</p>

<p>“We regret to find the following statement by Mr.
Winstow, one of the American missionaries, who visited
Tanjore in 1828: ‘The Rajah has become very unfriendly
with the missionaries. He has yielded himself up to
dissipation and given immense sums to the Brahmins,
and to the temples to make himself a Brahmin. His only
son is growing up in ignorance, making no steady
application to any study of science.’ (<i>American
Missionary Herald</i>, vol. xxv. p. 140.)”</p>

<p>In his case, at any rate, he could not excuse his neglect
of salvation on the plea of lack of knowledge.</p>

<p>The directors of the East India Company were equally
anxious to perpetuate the memory of one whom they
held in conspicuous honour. What Serfogee had done at
Tanjore they would do in the Church of St. Mary in
Fort St. George, Madras. On 29th October, 1807, by
the direction of the court a letter was written to say
that a marble monument by Bacon was on its way to be
erected there in memory of Mr. Schwartz. “As the most
appropriate testimony of the deep sense we entertain of
his transcendent merit, of his unwearied and disinterested
labours to the cause of religion and piety, and the exercise
of the finest and most exalted benevolence, also of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
public services at Tanjore, where the influence of his name
and character, through the unbounded confidence and
veneration which they inspired, was for a long course of
years productive of important benefits to the Company.”
This beautiful monument, worthy of a sculptor of such
eminence, represented also the death scene, with the
exception that here Serfogee is absent, but one of the
native children is embracing the hand of the dying
missionary, his friend Kohlhoff supporting him by his
arm, the figure of an angel bearing a cross is depicted
above. There is also included below the group, emblems
of the pastoral office—the Episcopal Crozier, the Gospel
trumpet with the banners of the Cross, and an open Bible,
upon which is inscribed the divine mandate of all
missionary enterprise, “Go ye unto all the world and
preach the gospel to every creature.”</p>

<p>Above is shown the ark of the covenant, and the whole
is a most appropriate and artistic piece of work. The
inscription was written by Mr. Huddleston, then one of the
directors of the Company, and a very intimate and valued
friend of Schwartz, and is in these words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">
Sacred to the memory of<br>
<span class="smcap">The Rev. Christian Frederic Schwartz</span>,<br>
whose life was one continued effort to imitate the example of<br>
his Blessed Master.<br>
</p>

<p>Employed as a Protestant missionary from the Government
of Denmark, and in the same character by the
Society in England for the Promotion of Christian
Knowledge, he, during a period of fifty years, “went
about doing good,” manifesting, in respect to himself,
the most entire abstraction from temporal views, but
embracing every opportunity of promoting both the temporal
and eternal welfare of others. In him religion
appeared not with a gloomy aspect or forbidding mien,
but with a graceful form and placid dignity. Among the
many fruits of his indefatigable labours was the Erection
of the Church at Tanjore. The savings from a small
salary were, for many years, devoted to this pious work,
and the remainder of the expense supplied by individuals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
at his solicitation. The Christian Seminaries of Ramanadporam
and in the Tinnevelly province were established
by him.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Beloved and Honoured by Europeans</span>,</p>

<p>he was, if possible, held in still deeper reverence by the
Natives of this Country, of every degree and every sect;
and their unbounded confidence in his integrity and
truth was, on many occasions, rendered highly beneficial
to the public Service.</p>

harm to my Government”.</p>

<p>Here the last twenty years of his life were spent in the
Education and Religious Instruction of Children, particularly

the presence of several of his disconsolate brethren,
entreating them to continue to make religion the first
object of their care, and imploring with his last breath
the divine blessing on their labours, he closed his truly

<p>The removal of Schwartz from his earthly sphere of
labour was the heaviest blow which Christian missions had
yet received. His name is one of the very first to be written
in the bede roll of great Indian missionaries. The
Church thanks God for their glorious service, and for
the splendid spirit with which they did their Master’s
will. But in the days when Schwartz closed his great
career the missionary cause was still in its infancy, the
pioneer example as regards our own country was the
Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, who had
so nobly stood as foster parent to the Danish missionaries
in Southern India, and the Society for the Propagation
of the Gospel, who took over the work. But a crisis was
rapidly approaching, for the enthusiasm which made
Germany hitherto the fount and origin of missionary
enterprise was cooling under the spell of a materialistic
wave, a change which Schwartz did not fail to feel even
at his distance from Europe, and lamented over. He had
left behind him some faithful colleagues, in whose hands
the work would be safe, but he foresaw difficulties which
would arise when in their turn—and they were not young
men—the responsibility of pastoral oversight and leading
would fall into other hands.</p>

<p>The loss of Schwartz was felt all the more because
he was such a remarkable personality, one of those men
of whom it is fairly admitted that it is extremely
difficult for another to take their place. Many men can
do mighty works, but only the few can beget love and inspire,
not only amongst their friends and converts, but in
the hearts of worldly wise civilians, and the priests of
pagan religions, a sincere and respectful confidence. It
may be said in truth of Schwartz that in both these
directions he had no equal in his day.</p>

<p>He was wont to bewail his own imperfections, and
those of his letters which portray the inner reflections of
his mind, show his humility, and how little he thought of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
himself. But we may take with confidence the judgment
of his contemporaries, who had not only a personal
knowledge of him, but saw with their own eyes the reality
of the work he had done in India.</p>

<p>The Rev. Dr. Kerr, the senior chaplain at Fort St.
George, who was careful to make the fullest inquiry, and
to whom was entrusted the erection of the monument in
St. Mary’s Church from the East India Company, paid
him a high tribute in a sermon. Speaking of Schwartz,
after following his honourable career in the East, he sums
up his character in these words:</p>

<p>“Such a course of life, zealously pursued for a long
series of years, and accompanied with that sweetly social
disposition for which he was remarkable, gained him
many friends and thousands of admirers. The blessing
of the fatherless and the widow came upon him, and his
hope was gladness. He rejoiced evermore in witnessing
the divine effect of his honest endeavours, and if he did
not make converts of all with whom he associated, he
seldom failed to make friends of them with whom he
happened to communicate. Not that he ever compromised
a paramount duty from any false politeness or deference
to superior station; for he decidedly and openly declared
the condemnation of all who boldly and openly set gospel
rules at defiance, as often as an opportunity for the purpose
occurred. His reproof, however, was tempered with
so much good nature, the desire of doing good to the
offenders was so obviously his intention, that he seldom
provoked the smallest ill-will by the strong but fatherly
remonstrance which irreligious conversation and conduct
frequently drew from him. Indeed, he seemed peculiarly
gifted by divine providence with a happy manner, which
enabled him to turn almost every occurrence, whether
great or trivial, to the praise and glory of God.”</p>

<p>With reference to his services as a peace mediator
between the Government and Hyder Ali, and in other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
similar instances when he was able to assist in the better
government and development of the people, Dr. Kerr
says:</p>

<p>“Amidst such great public undertakings and the high
degree of consideration attached by all ranks of people in
this country to Mr. Schwartz’s character, every road to
the gratification of ambition and avarice was completely
open to him. Courted by the prince of the country in
which he resided, reverenced almost to adoration by the
people at large, confidentially employed by the English
Government in objects of the first political importance—to
his honour it must be recorded, that he continued to
value those things only as they appeared likely to prove
subservient to his missionary work, as they made funds
to assist him with building of his churches or the establishment
of his schools over the country. With the single
eye of the Gospel, he looked only to the effusion of divine
truth, and the glad tidings of salvation through faith in
Jesus Christ. The same principle which raised him in
the public estimation, he continued to cherish in every
stage of his devotion; untarnished by the venality and
corruption which from various quarters it is well known
assailed his virtue, he continued his missionary life
carrying his cross and following the steps of his Divine
Master to the end of his earthly being.”</p>

<p>Only three days before his own sudden death, Bishop
Heber wrote an estimation of Schwartz, which is all the
more valuable because it contains a frank admission of
a mistaken impression he had previously formed concerning
one side of his character.</p>

<p>“Of Schwartz and his fifty years’ labour among the
heathen, the extraordinary influence and popularity which
he acquired, both with Mussulmans, Hindus, and contesting
European Governments, I need give you no
account, except that my idea of him has been raised
since I came in the South of India. I used to suspect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
that, with many admirable qualities, there was too great
a mixture of intrigue in his character; that he was too
much of a political prophet, and that the veneration
which the heathen paid, and still pay, him, and which
indeed almost regards him as a superior being, putting
crowns and burning lights before his statue, was purchased
by some unwarrantable compromise with their
prejudices. I find I was quite mistaken. He was really
one of the most active and fearless, as he was one of the
most successful missionaries who have appeared since the
apostles. To say that he was disinterested in regard to
money is nothing; he was perfectly regardless of power,
and renown never seemed to affect him, even so far as to
induce an outward show of humility. His temper was
perfectly simple, open, and cheerful; and in his political
negotiations (employments which he never sought for,
but which fell in his way) he never pretended to
impartiality, but acted as the avowed, though certainly
the successful and judicious agent of the orphan prince
entrusted to his care, and from attempting whose conversion
to Christianity he seems to have abstained from
a feeling of honour.”</p>

<p>With respect to this closing remark about Serfogee,
it is open to question whether the venerable missionary
would have quite appreciated the compliment the Bishop
pays him. It is always a cause for regret that this
Indian prince, the object of so much solicitude on the
part of Schwartz, should, after all, have died a pagan.
But the fact of his not having died a Christian was
scarcely due to any lack of pains taken by Schwartz
towards his conversion, and it is still less likely that he
would have avoided pressing upon him the claims of religion
from a delicate sense of honour as his guardian. The
evidence is all the other way, not only as regards Serfogee,
but also the old Rajah Tuljajee, who was unhappily
very far from being a Christian. In the case of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
former the many letters, such as a Christian father would
write to a son, from which some quotations have already
been given, show that, though the gospel was continually
impressed upon the attention of this young prince, he
clung to his idolatries in spite of these earnest appeals,
backed up, as they were, by a sincere personal affection
on both sides. As regards the old Rajah, it was stated
by Mr. Huddleston, who knew him well, that at one time
he was fully convinced of the truths of the Christian
religion, and was on the point of making a public avowal
of it, but the harsh and unjust treatment he received
from the Madras Government, which, of course, being
European, had the reputation of being Christian,
entirely turned him against the faith. One might
imagine a mind half made up being thus affected, but,
whether this held him back or not, we know how much
he was under the domination of the Brahmins, and how
pathetically he used to address Schwartz as “his padre.”
The real reason for this sad condition spiritually was
not only his attachment to the gods of his fathers, but
his love of those sins which in time broke up his health
and ruined his power.</p>

<p>Bishop Wilson of Calcutta in 1839, in giving his
charge to his clergy, speaks in strong terms of recommendation
of Schwartz, and in doing so gives some very
interesting personal touches of his daily life.</p>

<p>“Permit me again to recommend the example of this
eminent missionary. The biography of such a man is a
<i>study</i>, as the artists speak. I have stood on Schwartz’s
grave, I have visited his house, I have been in the room
in which he died; I have seen his garden, his burial
ground, and his mission schools. I have preached twice
in his church. Never can I bless God enough for the
honour of being permitted to speak of the unsearchable
riches of Christ in this seat of the missionary’s labours.
The venerable Kohlhoff was under him thirty-five years.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
He never knew him angry or indignant, except when any
servants of the Lord were acting inconsistently or timidly—then
he was all on fire. Once Sattianaden threw
difficulties in undertaking a journey. Schwartz was
much displeased and dispatched him instantly, with a
sharp rebuke for dishonouring the high calling of Christ.
His strength for labour was wonderful: five duties he
performed every Sunday, one of them being the whole
English morning service. He preached twenty or thirty
minutes, and was very affectionate in his manner. He
read constantly his Hebrew Bible and his Greek Testament.
Every day he assembled his catechists and native
priests to early prayers, and then sent them out, ‘You
go there,’ ‘You visit such a circle,’ ‘You see how such
and such families are going on.’ They returned about
four, and reported their proceedings. He went himself
to the schools, families, residents’ abodes, came in about
one and remained at home studying or writing till four,
when the catechists returned. He then took them with
him, and seated himself in the mission churchyard or in
his house, according to the season, and invited the
heathen to converse and hear him read the scriptures.
He was mild, but very authoritative; very acute also in
answering their objections, and never allowed himself to
be embarrassed. In the evening he called for his moonshee,
and heard him read the Persian poets or historians,
hoping particularly to relieve his spirits.</p>

<p>“He always inspired respect, no one dared to trifle
with him. He had a good deal of policy and great
sagacity on emergencies. His influence was supreme;
his word law; his example and conduct consistent, frank
and benignant, but with a firmness and almost sternness
of purpose which kept all around him in implicit
subjection. Mr. Kohlhoff’s strongest impression is of
the authority he had acquired—no one dared or dreamt
of opposing his various missions. He was master of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
everything and everybody. He, the father, and all the
other missionaries, catechists, children, his family.
Schwartz was, in short, father, priest, and judge. He
was accustomed to say, ‘Will you prefer my punishment
or the Rajah’s?’ ‘Oh, Padre, yours!’ The word was
no sooner said than the sentence was awarded. In the
science of governing mankind and in habits of business
he must have resembled Wesley.</p>

<p>“As Mr. Kohlhoff sat by me at dinner, I asked him
as to Schwartz’s general habits. He told me that he rose
at five, breakfasted at six or seven, on a basin of tea made
in an open jug, with hot water poured on it, and some
bread cut into it. One half was for himself, the other for
Kohlhoff. The meal lasted not five minutes. He dined
on broth and curry very much as the natives. He never
touched wine, except one glass on a Sunday. What was
sometimes sent to him was reserved for the sick. His
temperance was extraordinary, habitual, and enjoined on
his catechists and brethren. He supped at eight, and
after reading a chapter in the Hebrew Bible in private,
and his own devotions, retired to rest about ten.”</p>

<p>In making a final estimate of Schwartz, gathering
from the elements of evidence before us some means of
judging his character, one cannot help feeling that he
stood midway between the missionaries who preceded him
and those who were to succeed him. The old order was
soon to change. For many years the Danish Mission,
brave pioneers struggling against many difficulties, had
represented, not unworthily, the cause of Christianity in
India. They were under disadvantages, limited in the
area of their work by the political turmoil of the time,
and also a little straitened in themselves. It is not to be
expected that these early confessors of the faith could
exercise the same judgment and fertility of resource
which are the characteristics of the modern missionary.
Their training at Halle was thorough enough, they held<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
a sound theology, exercised a simple faith, with great
diligence they acquired the Tamil and other languages
necessary for their work, and they had a burning zeal for
the salvation of the heathen. But they had no missionary
literature to lead and instruct them, and, until Schultze
came back to Halle, they had no experienced missionary
to explain the nature of their work, and how to meet its
difficulties. They also lacked that invaluable element of
supervision and control which a Committee at the back
of the workers affords at home, and which, though not
without some disadvantages for which the frailty of
human judgment is responsible, is acknowledged to be a
strength to missionary enterprise. To a certain extent
every man, and they were few, was a law unto himself.
We are not forgetful of the fact that in the days of
Ziegenbalg, his end was hastened by the arrogance of a
missionary board at Copenhagen, under the domination
of a self-opinionated tyrant, and that his able coadjutor
Gründler also died of a broken heart from the same cause.
But until the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge
took over the workers, not only providing the sinews of
war, but the still more effective counsel and prayer, they
went on their way, fighting their battles, bearing their
burdens, sometimes making their blunders, doing the best
they could on the spot according to their realization of
the immediate need. Even when Schwartz came upon
the scene the simplicity and independence of the work as
a Lutheran Evangelical mission was still maintained.
One of the leading missionaries of to-day describes the
position of the work in those old days in the following
words:</p>

<p>“The missionaries themselves used to confirm and
meet together for ordinations. The catechists used to
baptize. Each congregation was independent, and ruled
by its own missionary, although the missionaries would
occasionally meet, as it were, in synod, and were in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
habit of accepting guidance of any more prominent men,
as, for example, of Schwartz, whom his brother
missionaries always regarded as their spiritual father, and
created into a quasi-bishop. Each missionary in local
affairs was assisted by his catechists, who, under his
presidency, formed a sort of disciplinary council, the
decisions of which in various matters brought before them
were usually confirmed by the civil power. The
missionary was, in fact, regarded as the head of the community,
in the same principle as native headmen were
recognized, and was permitted to fine, flog, and otherwise
punish offenders belonging to his community.”</p>

<p>It is not surprising that under this rather complex
system of self-government, without lines of direct communication
with England, Denmark, and Germany, a
born administrator like Schwartz should have been looked
up to with reverence and confidence. For he had the
faculty of managing men with cheerfulness, and yet, as
one had said of him, Schwartz commanded instant respect
to his wishes, and made others feel their inferiority without
any sense of fear. He had a personal charm, the
power of exercising a powerful influence which inspired
confidence, even with those natives who were ready to
distrust everything European. He never lost touch with
his people. One who knew him well in his relation to
others reveals the secret of his great influence. “They
saw,” he says, “other Europeans in succession lift themselves
from obscurity and humble stations to affluence,
rank and power, then disappear and others take their
places, but none taking any interest in their welfare or
making use of them except as a means of accomplishing
their own aggrandizement, but <i>Schwartz remained with
them</i>. In him they always saw the same unaspiring
meekness, and found in him the same kind and disinterested
friend. What could the natives of India among
whom he lived conclude respecting such a man, but that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
which they did conclude, and which was a common
observation among them when he was spoken of, namely,
that he was unlike and superior to all other men!”</p>

<p>His very abilities and influence drew him within the
dangerous zone of political affairs, and the fact that he
stood so well with the powers that were the
representatives of the British Government, might well
have corrupted a man of less principle and sincerity. It
may be said of him that he sat at the tables of rich men
and talked on equal terms with the ambitious spirits of
his time, but he kept his piety and simplicity through
it all. They trusted his sagacity and leaned on his
judgment in difficult situations, but they knew he was not
to be bribed, and that he kept a clean hand. He was a
scholar, and had a good knowledge of the classics, of
German literature; he was also master of Hebrew, Tamil,
Persian, Hindustani, Mahratta, and the Indo-Portuguese
languages. There is no doubt that his linguistic powers
were very helpful to him, as we have seen, they so often
enabled him to get past the crafty Brahmins, and converse
with the Rajah or the Pariah alike in their own
tongue about the truths of Christianity.</p>

<p>While he promoted the growth of a native ministry
and took great pains to train his catechists to a point of
efficiency, he was not disposed to believe that India could
ever dispense with European missionaries, who carried
with them a weight of influence and respect which a
native, however worthy, could not successfully obtain. At
the same time he foresaw the importance and necessity
of a native ministry under the jurisdiction of English
leaders. This was shown in the ordination, by the rites
of the Lutheran Church, of Sattianaden, who lived to a
ripe old age, and was eminently useful in the work, and
whose office as minister was cordially sanctioned by the
Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. It is a
fact sometimes hardly appreciated that a great part of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
almost every day was spent by Schwartz in training his
catechists for the work of the ministry. There existed
then no colleges to undertake this important duty,
and the remote possibility that one day in India
native clergy would hold their degrees from Oxford
and Cambridge never entered into his wildest
dreams. He was content and happy to do his part, and
in doing this so faithfully he was preparing the way for
the wonderful developments in the service of natives
which should come in the future.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, although there was a growing
appreciation of the value of utilising native converts as
catechists and helpers in the days following Schwartz,
there appears to have been a corresponding reluctance to
ordain them, save in exceptional cases, to the work of the
ministry. The day of a native clergy dawned slowly.
We have it on record that, so far nearer our present time
as 1851, “although there were over 493 catechists and
preachers there were under all the societies at work in
India only twenty-one ordained native pastors.”</p>

<p>The extreme care and thoroughness of Schwartz in his
training of a native agency was justified, and followed by
the higher educational and intellectual preparation set on
foot by the wise policy of the missionary societies. However
it may answer elsewhere, it was not sufficient for
work in India that the native should go forth with the
simple equipment of an earnest heart and the Gospel
message. Dr. Richter, in his invaluable “History of
Missions,” puts the case clearly enough when he says:</p>

<p>“The man who attempted a discussion with either a
Hindu or a Mohammedan at a mela or in the bazaar was
as good as done for if his intellectual equipments were not
equal or superior to that of his adversary; and such an
equipment means not only a thorough knowledge of the
Scriptures, but also an intimate acquaintance with the
sacred literature of his opponents, when possible in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
original languages, and sufficient theological and
dialectic training to measure the distance against their
system of religion. Further, it lay in the very nature
of things that converts from high castes, who had only
found the pearl of great price after long and sore conflict,
should themselves burn with desire to commend this great
treasure to their fellow-countrymen, and that as educated
men they not only possessed the ability to profit by, but
likewise might equitably claim a thorough theological
training.”</p>

<p>In the case of a high caste Brahmin convert, we can
easily see that the equipment as regards knowledge of his
old creed is ready-made, but with a lower caste, say a
Pariah, it would be obviously almost as difficult to acquire
as with a European missionary. The question is one of
great difficulty, and involves issues which affect the true
and effective preparation of the western, as well as the
eastern worker in India.</p>

<p>No one can, however, read the letters and journals of
Schwartz without recognizing that he solved the problem.
A trained mind, an unwavering faith in God, a complete
mastery of Brahmin literature, a still better knowledge
of his Bible, the engaging art of winning the hearts of
his hearers, a never flinching denunciation of idolatry and
sin, a willingness to listen and to sympathize, an absolute
fidelity to the Christian doctrine, a yearning love for the
souls of men, a meek yet passionate love for the Saviour,
these were the constituents of his character and service.
Is it any wonder that they loved and trusted him? They
gave him many titles of respect and honour, some very
tender, but when with reverence they called him “The
Christian,” that name was the best of all.</p>
